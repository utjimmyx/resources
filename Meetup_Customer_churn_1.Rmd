Note: this analysis was performed using the open source software R and Rstudio.

## Introduction

Customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service, also known as customer attrition. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. The industry in which churn rates are particularly useful may include the telecommunications industry, the healthcare industry, the insurance industry, etc. because most customers have multiple options from which to choose within a geographic location.

In this lab, we are going to analyze customer churn using telecom dataset available from Kaggle. We will introduce some basic exploratory analysis to help you understand the nature of customer churn. 

##What is customer churn?
Imagine that you have 10 customers who switch to your competitors (e.g., cancel your service’s subscription) and you originally signed 100 customers during that time period, your churn rate would be:
```{r}
churn <- 10
original <- 100
Churn_rate <- churn/original
# How much is the Churn rate? See the result below: 
Churn_rate
```

In the industries listed above, the average churn rate is about 20% to 40%. Reducing your churn rate is important because your customers are critical for your business growth (Salesmate, 2021).

## Case study - We will be using a real world dataset available in Kaggle for this tutorial (see the reference)


```{r}

churn <- read.csv('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv', na.strings = c('','?'))
#install.packages("DT")
#install.packages("DT")
#install.packages("cowplot")
#install.packages(c("ggplot2","plyr"),dep=T)
#error  - The following `from` values were not present in `x`
#solution - install plyr using the function above
str(churn)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(DT)
library(cowplot)
datatable(churn, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 6, scrollX= T))

#we use the sapply function to remove all missing values
sapply(churn, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
#Exploratory analysis
head(churn)
summary(churn)

bi1 <- ggplot(data = churn, aes(x = factor(Churn), y = tenure, fill = Churn)) +geom_boxplot()
#Explanation - High churn for those with lower tenures

bi2 <- ggplot(data = churn, aes(x = factor(Churn), y = MonthlyCharges, fill = Churn))+geom_boxplot()
#Explanation - Higher churn for those with higher than avg monthly charges

bi3 <- ggplot(data = churn, aes(x = factor(Churn), y = TotalCharges, fill = Churn))+geom_boxplot()
#Explanation - Lower churn for those with lower than avg total charges

plot_grid(bi1, bi2, bi3, labels = "AUTO")

#Partner plot

p1 <- ggplot(churn, aes(x = Partner, fill = Partner)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(y = ..count.. -200, 
                label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..),4) * 100, '%')), 
            stat = 'count', 
            position = position_dodge(.1), 
            size = 3)
## using default colors - specify the fill argument within the aes function to be equal to the grouping variable of Partner

#Dependents plot
p2 <- ggplot(churn, aes(x = Dependents, fill = Dependents)) +
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(y = ..count.. -200, 
                label = paste0(round(prop.table(..count..),4) * 100, '%')), 
            stat = 'count', 
            position = position_dodge(.1), 
            size = 3)
