Did anyone else get this feeling about Mon Mothma and Luthen Rael?,4/10/2025,1744272596,Did anyone else get this feeling about Mon Mothma and Luthen Rael?,"**SPOILERS for Andor Season 1**

I just finished binge-watching Andor Season 1 (finally!) in anticipation of Season 2 releasing in a couple of weeks. Brilliant show that I can't rave enough about!

Something occurred to me though around the episode 10-11 mark which sure puts a darker complexion on Mon Mothma's situation.

Luthen Rael is shown to be a ruthless, amoral figure prepared to do *anything* for the Rebellion - including coercing his agent to remain with the ISB by subtly threatening hs family, letting Anto Kreegyr and his men die to protect said ISB mole, and sending Vel and Cinta to kill Andor simply because Andor had seen his face!

Keeping this in mind, one wonders what he would be prepared to do to Mon Mothma if *she* became a liability to him. Which she would become if her illicit transactions to finance the Rebellion came to light and she was arrested and interrogated. Unlike Andor, she knows Luthien's name and a great deal about him and his network.

Was *this* why Mon Mothma was desperate enough to let her daughter potentially be betrothed to a gangster's son?

Another further chilling element to this - Vel's stern insistence that Mothma's financial dealing *cannot* be exposed. Which leads you to realize that if Luthen *did* want Mon Mothma dead before she could expose him, he'd probably send Vel to kill her. So Vel was not only trying to save her cousin's life with her warning, she was also hoping to prevent a situation wherein *she* might be compelled to kill her cousin :O

In the long run, I'm curious to see how the Mon Mothma-Luthen Rael situation pans out, though we obviously know that Mon ends up becoming the leader of the Rebellion while Rael is seemingly forgotten (and dead?)",StarWars,9

Anakin would have faced no punishment if he revealed his relationship with Padme to the council during RotS by the novel's presentation of the war,4/26/2025,1745703944,Anakin would have faced no punishment if he revealed his relationship with Padme to the council during RotS by the novel's presentation of the war,"I was reading the Revenge of the Sith novel and I was thinking, Anakin didn't want to reveal his relationship with Padme cause he would be removed from the Order. The thing is though, although doing this would make the council trust him less and even get angry at him, they could never afford to and would not do something as ignorant as expelling him from the order. Padme earlier in the book was telling Anakin how the only reason ppl still had good opinion of the Jedi was because of Anakin and the book constantly stresses how much of a legend Anakin is the eyes of the people. The council also still needed Anakin to spy on Palpatine for them. On top of all this, with the war coming to an unsure end, the possibility of Palpatine needing to being removed, the loss of Jedi from the war, and the fact the Jedi knew something was off about Anakin at the time, they undoubtedly would have done next to nothing about him having a relationship with Padme. I'd even go as far as to say that would give the Jedi traction in the Senate since Padme was as trusted as she was. I know most of this outside perspective he wouldn't have but I'm still just throwing out an opinion",StarWars,15

My first book was Darth Plagueis. Blew my mind completely. Luceno did such a tremendous, fantastic job! 

Then, I started the Thrawn (2017) trilogy and finished it last night! Timothy Zahn is the GOAT! 

Can't really afford to buy them right now, so I've been checking them out of the library and just picked up the next two, Thrawn: Alliances and Thrawn: Treason.

I'm so happy I've ventured down this journey of reading these books.

I've been thinking about starting the original Thrawn Trilogy after I'm done with these ones, but not sure if I wanted to maybe try something different like the Darth Bane series.

Some thoughts on Count Dooku,4/21/2025,1745217209,Some thoughts on Count Dooku,"The last sentence of this paragraph ( from an explanation of Count Dooku's history in the order, and his subsequent exit ) is mostly the topic of what I wanna talk about. I want to clarify, I am by no means an expert and if I say something that is established to be true / false within the official canon I apologize!

So, it's *well* established the Count Dooku is *extremely* gifted, and was hailed as one of the most talented lightsaber masters and users of telekinetic-type force powers specifically. But I have this theory that he might *actually* be even more gifted than is generally understood. My theory also has to do with why Count Dooku is one of the few ( if not possibly the *only* ) Sith Master who doesn't have the ""Sith Eyes"", and why the Jedi council is so.. like That"" about emotions and attachments. I'll start my explanation with the attachment and emotions thing.

So, I'm pretty sure the biggest reason for that unshakable determination to teach the need for a white-knuckle grip on one's emotions and strict ban on attachments, is directly related to the Dark Side's corrupting effect. The Force is established to have a sort of life of its own so what if, when a Force user taps into the Force, *they* have absolutely no control over which ""side"" of the Force provides them with the power they're trying to use. So, when you're under control and calm, the Light Side is what you tap into, but if you tap into the Force while your emotions are volatile, or you're *actively* seeking to use the Force to harm the opponent, its the Dark Side that gives that power. So, if you aren't disciplined enough, or for example you've formed an attachment and that person is hurt or killed and you *obviously* lose it, the Dark Side answers your call whether you want it to or not. And because of it's ability corrupt any it provides with power,  even a momentary mistake could completely change even a master Jedi. *That's* why they're so strict, even though it's dumb AF to expect people to perfectly control their emotions and never connect with anyone, because those who have particularly weak willpower would otherwise absolutely fall to the Dark Side.

Now, onto Count Dooku, the sentence in the photo, and his lack of ""Sith Eyes"". What if Count Dooku thought the Order were just weak willed, and even ""proved them wrong"" in his mind, not because he was right and they just didn't understand how to control the Dark Side, but because he has a unique Force ability that, combined with his latent talent and his years of training, made him immune / resistant to the Dark Side's corruption? I just think it'd be really funny that he's over here thinking every Jedi Master to *ever* exist was just too lazy and weak willed to learn to resist the corruption, when in reality he just had a natural gift lmao",StarWars,5

The Solo cliffhanger, to some maul has been overused since his return, and his story having an end. But Im super glad and excited we are getting a truly Sith focused TV show. I hope the show runners take the show where they see it best, but I do hope some key points are touched on. 

- Solo A Star Wars Cliffhanger needs to be touched on. I know the show is to start 1 year after order 66, but depending on the season count we could see it time jump around and if so Id like to see what was intended to happen after Solo for him. 

- How did Maul end up on Malachor, obviously this is likely to be at the end of the show however long that takes to reach us, but it would still be interesting to see. 

- Most fan-service type request, A Maul v. Vader fight. Or at least a face to face conversation. Aside from a select few, Maul is the strongest force wielder left in the galaxy and I really cant think of another opponent he could fight in the show that would make sense for him to see. His remarks in rebels makes it obvious he is well aware of Vader and what he is capable of. Inquisitors dont really phase him at all so hopefully Vader dismantling his criminal empire is how they come face to face. ",StarWars,16

Revenge Of The Sith Rerelease is This Weekend!!!!,4/24/2025,1745466597,Revenge Of The Sith Rerelease is This Weekend!!!!,"For a variety of reasons, every Star Wars fan who cares about the franchise and what it means to multiple generations of people should make the pilgrimage to the theater this weekend to see Revenge of the Sith. 

Regardless of how you feel about the prequels, I think it can be agreed that the treatment of George Lucas was at least extremely crass and disrespectful. This is a chance to show how much his work is appreciated decades after release, that his work at the turn of the century has and will build a legacy similar to his work on the originals. As well as that the hate and vitriol that was directed at the three prequel films and at Lucas himself is not carried by moviegoers and fans today. 

Additionally, I feel that a strong showing for this film and this rerelease, ideally a surprisingly strong showing, potentially resulting in an extended release window (very wishful thinking), could help show that there is a large market of fans waiting for quality content that may feel underserved by recent efforts.  It is important to show to analysts and to the heads of Lucasfilm that there is still a large audience of fans ready to engage even if they feel dissatisfied with recent projects. 

I love the saga that was brought full circle with revenge of the Sith. Its such an elemental, deeply resonant story that stands strong on so many levels and provides moments and emotions that regular blockbusters can never achieve. Everything after that has been varying degrees of extremely fun and entertaining to shitteringly bad and boring. Any long running entertainment franchise will have those moments. 

But this is a rare chance for all of us, whether dejected or still all in and watching everything they put out. This is our chance to, and I grimace as I paraphrase what fluctuates between my least and 2nd least favorite Star Wars film, not fight what we hate, but celebrate what we love.",StarWars,5

But i also love to read. Comics and books. 

As an apprentice I come seeking the power of the lore. 

Id like to focus just on canon for now and im curious if i want to read books or read comics what are the best orders. It can be chronological (thats how im doing the mega watch thru right now) or it can be in the order that will make it make the most sense or have the greatest impact on the story telling. Also the reading orders of the comics and the books dont have to match up with the video media or even each other for that matter. I dont want to overly complicate the indulgence of the lore i just wanna go deeper.

Hopefully this kind of post is ok i know in a lot of subreddits these kinds of posts pop up all the time. Im just gonna be honest i thought its better to ask than to search so i dont pick the wrong order etc.

If it matters my favorite parts of the universe rn are the sith, the lightsabers, the dogfighting/piloting stuff, and the force&also the hutts intrigue me. The aliens are pretty cool too but i appreciate how they just are, and not a huge focal point.

Slow war spy drama, fighting fascism, compelling characters, beautiful cinematography, and great writing! Also the story plots are great!

The rebellion espionage is probably one of my favorite eras besides clone wars.

Why Dedra was Lying.,4/26/2025,1745641694,Why Dedra was Lying.,"In 4 BBY, Dedra tells Eedy that she was raised in an Imperial kinder-block.

The Empire was established in 19 BBY.

We don't know how old Dedra Meero is but Denise Gough is 45. 

We can safely assume that Dedra is between 35-50 years old because she's roughly the same age as most other officers of her rank and position. You also don't get a job like hers fresh out of the academy; she's got years of experience behind her already.

You might be able to stretch things so that she could have been taken in as a teenager but she's simply too old to have been raised in an Imperial kinder-block without ever knowing family.

Aside from the fact that the ISB is an intelligence agency so she's basically a spy, why would Dedra say such a thing to someone who was around her own age during the Clone Wars? 

Because Eedy is an annoyance and an irritant that disturbs Dedra's orderly controlled world, just like the people of Ghorman... This scene isn't just Dedra taking down the dreaded mother-in-law, this is the Empire dealing with a nuisance. 

This scene demonstrates one of the ways propaganda works *because Eedy should know that Dedra is lying about the kinder-block.* The blatant lie that started it all is buried by a demonstration of authority, a threat, and an already decided resolution. Even if Eedy noticed the lie, by the time Dedra is done she has no choice but to forget it or face the consequences for even asking about it.

In other words, when Dedra says she was raised in an Imperial kinder-block, it is a lie that metaphorically says ""I am the Empire."" The rest of her speech to Eedy says ""you will not question anything about me, you will know only what I tell you, you will not question my authority, you will do what I say, when I say it, and if you don't I'll make you pay.""

She's not channeling the Emperor, she's channeling the Empire.

I don't see this as a matter of ""Dedra's gonna get a good idea for Ghorman from this"" so much as a demonstration of the talents that got her her job in the first place. She knows the playbook so well she can use it in any situation.

Im but 18 years old and have never experienced the Star Wars community gathered like this before. I remember the sequels releasing but neither the hype in the theater or around the movie was as big as this. My brother, 10 years older, got to watch the movie on release and said the hype around it was as big as it was yesterday.

Hearing everyone burst out in applause and cheers when the main theme starts playing sent shivers down my spine. Truly an opening meant for theaters. The atmosphere was amazing too, everyone gathered with the same love for the franchise and the movie.

I love the meme side of the prequels as its shared amusement amongst everyone. At every meme line everyone cheered. This is where the fun begins, Hello there, which everyone conveniently replied General Kenobi too. Im still stunned from everyone cheering when Anakin killed the youngling, that caught me so off guard cus I was almost tearing up.

The absolute best part is how the whole place is filled with suspense when Obi-Wan is seen behind Padm<U+00E9> on Mustafar, and he confronts Anakin. Then cheers and applause burst out as the fight begins.

Best highlights of the theater experience:

- The aging of the CGI was only grossly apparent when Obi and Anakin are trapped in the ray shields on the Invisible Hand. And the CGI fight of Sidious and Yoda on the chancellors pod in the senate. 

-Mace Windu he has control of the senate and the courts, hes too dangerous to be left alive. People hate on Mace but he was right about Anakin and that situation. 

-The opening battles CGI stands up today so well. It does look slightly aged but gave me the feel of the OT space battles. Perfectly campy

-Anakin Vs Obi Wan. That fight is built for the big screen I tell ya.

I was getting to play a version of this character that I hadnt before, and that was the all-knowing, all-powerful Jedi master who could wield both sides of the force light and dark at will, and maybe has the power to save Ahsokas life, which also is very interesting because thats the power that he was trying to achieve when he pledged himself to the dark side.

Pretty cool. Do you guys think that Anakin is the Father now? Supposedly that might happen in Ahsoka season 2, according to the rumors. And Abeloth is supposed to be in it too. It would make sense, that was originally what he was supposed to become if you remember the Mortis episodes in TCW.",StarWars,51

Okay background (older fans pls be nice ) I in fact was not alive by the time the last prequel came into theaters so the Force awakens was truly the first Star Wars movie I had ever watched in all my time being alive!!! I was like eight when the teaser trailer of TFA came out, 9-10 when it finally released my main fav media was Disney princesses still!! 

Going into the Force awakens I didn't know what to expect only that it was a Star Wars movie but oh my god as someone who just turned double digit when I watched it in theaters that movie was like the best movie I had ever watched in my short decade of being alive ever!!! I remember getting so excited and cheering for Rey and Finn piloting the falcon, and Rey discovering her powers and leaning forward in anticipation when she fought Kylo Ren and wanting her to beat him. I remember bouncing up and down in excitement to my parents immediately after coming out like a kid in a candy shop practically screaming in fangirl agony 

 ""I can't believe I have to wait 2 years for the next movie to release! I'm gonna be 12 I'm almost gonna be a teen and by the time the last movie hits I'll be a teenager wow that's gonna be a long time""

Immediately after this movie I instantly got into MORE Star wars media like I instantly watched the original trilogy prequels freaking loved it was so hyped too see empire and rots for the first time core memory was screaming during ROTS Anakin mustafar duel thinking ""damn I wish I was alive to see this in theaters sucks I wasn't born yet :/""

I also got into Rebels &amp; rogue one become one of my fav movies the OT era fascinated me so much and I started just discovering more media as a lil nerdy girl in elementary school, like I got into legends and comics and would rush home after elementary school hop on my iPad to watch Legends lore videos and any updates for what the next Star wars movie could be !!!!! 

I credit The Force awakens as my introduction to the amazing world of Star Wars, and later in life I became a Star Wars cosplayer and met so many wonderful friends through our mutual love for this franchise 

I also know a lot of people still hate the sequels but as someone who felt outcasted and alone in her youth dressing up as Rey as a kid and watching sequel theories in elementary school gave me an escape and something to look forward to when I was growing up from a child to adolescent in a very confusing time in my life 

I will always hold love for these movies because they were my generation of Star Wars exactly like how I know prequel kids feel about their movies d",StarWars,17

Anakin vs Obi-Wan is the perfect example of why the Sith constantly lost against the Jedi and but also why Sith constantly put the Jedi on the brink of extinction.,4/22/2025,1745283404,Anakin vs Obi-Wan is the perfect example of why the Sith constantly lost against the Jedi and but also why Sith constantly put the Jedi on the brink of extinction.,"To put it simply, Anakin had every advantage over Obi-Wan, like, literally everything but he was in a horrible state of mind making him vulnerable. He made so many wrong choices in their fight, and because of it, he lost and spent the next 20 years in suffering and pain because Obi-Wan, in typical Jedi fashion couldn't commit to the kill.

The history of the Jedi vs the Sith is full of victory for the Jedi but them never putting the nail into the Sith as a whole. The ending of The Great Hyperspace war is a prime example of this. The Sith were defeated, retreated to their homeworlds and the Republic says ""Alright let's end this, raze their homes like they did ours and end this forever."" and the Jedi backed out. They didn't want to smash the Sith once and for all and didn't support the attack on the Sith when they had lost the war. Without Jedi support the Sith were able to scatter and regroup under Darth Vitiate, who found a place to rebuild their strength and war with the galaxy for another 4,000 years.

Sith Pride causes their defeat, but Jedi Mercy stops their death. Not even Luke or Rey directly attacked Palpatine they just defended themselves or in Luke's case, writhed in pain as this old man suddenly shot lightning from his hands. It's ironic that Mace Windu, one of the most non-typical Jedi was finally willing to strike down the Sith once and for all and in that moment gave birth to another.",StarWars,7

Rewatching Rogue One and another reason I love this film,4/14/2025,1744602601,Rewatching Rogue One and another reason I love this film,"The difficult part of being a Star Wars fan is keeping up with all the octopus legs of characters groups and story arcs. The high republic for example. But in Rogue One you meet new characters, who all die! So as a viewer youre taken along a myriad of emotions and get that gut punch as each character passes. And when the film is done you know that the story is complete. With a pass of the proverbial torch, the data disc, you know where the story goes next without any of our beloved characters. The turmoil of their deaths is comforted by the rebels victory in episode 4 it closes the film with such a high note, that adds just enough comfort to the fact youll never see these characters again.

I mean, there was a whole scrapped plotline introduced in the Agents of Chaos books where Artoo and Threepio had to process the Yuuzhan Vongs technophobic beliefs and how it impacted them as droids. The very existence of droids was under threat from the Yuuzhan Vong and their religious hatred of machines of any kind, and I cant help but feel that more independently-minded droids would band together or try to work towards achieving droids liberation in the face of such a threat. Heck, even if you still wanted to have the Second Galactic Civil War happen, you could make the droid rights movement one of the Confederations member factions, since theyd obviously hold a grudge against the Galactic Alliance for not doing something about their legitimate grievances and concerns.

Original Post: I live in India and I am a huge Star Wars fan. The Revenge of the Sith is supposed to be re-released on 25th April, 2025. The official [starwars.com](http://starwars.com) website says that the tickets are now available. But when I use BookMyShow (A platform for booking movie tickets in India), nothing shows up, even in the upcoming movies page. Even if I go to the official PVR website's 4DX page, there is no mention of *Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith.* Is this happening to everyone or just me? Was anybody else in India able to reserve seats?  
P.S.: I checked on Google and it says that the movie should be re-released on the 25th in the city I live in.

Edit: BookMyShow responded saying they are not aware if it will be released in India.

My name is Charlie, I'm an actor from the UK and a couple of days ago, a Star Wars FF I did came out. We've been overwhelmed with the really positive praise, and are so proud of it, that we'd love to reach more SW fans beyond our current audience. It was a lot of fun to make over around 5 years, and we've crammed in as much fanservice as we possibly can, mostly because we enjoy it. I play Rijl, a scrappy twi'lek bounty hunter, and as I've sat with this character and story for so long now, no one can convince me that it's not canon :)

Although, i feel as if there were way too many loose ends, for example: crosshairs shakey hand, Omegas force sensitivity and ventress.

I dont see the reason why omega was force sensitive, if they wanted to make her force sensitive they should have let her become a Jedi or create/join another force sensitive group which would have led to a new show. I dont hate the fact she fights with the rebellion but I feel as she had a lot more potential, especially with what was being built up.

I would have loved seeing ventress actually train Omega, omega was also young enough to take the training as she was still a child when ventress first showed up.

Ok hear me out. The Malevolence VS the Death Star,4/22/2025,1745285591,Ok hear me out. The Malevolence VS the Death Star,"I think it depends on what the situation is. If its a straight brawl then obviously the Malevolence loses hard. But in a realistic scenario, I dont think that would happen. Considering the Malevolence was designed as a hit and run dreadnought. Its ion cannon takes only a few seconds to fire, and it was considered one of the fastest. So I think it would go down like this. The Death Star being what it is, is probably coming into position to destroy a planet with a rebel base on it. Obviously the rebels know its there and are planning their strike on it. And they just so happened to have a Malevolence somehow (dont think too hard on that) and so they come up with a simple strategy. This absolute beast will hyperspace jump into position far behind the space station, take its couple of seconds to fire the ion cannon, and watch as the ion field quickly expands bigger than the Death Star and what Im assuming is its escort fleet. (its been shown that the ion field doesnt dissipate, so theoretically, you can shoot it from very very far away) and it all gets disabled. Then the Malevolence uses its vast amount of fire power to destroy everything in front of it. Ending the Imperial menace once and for all. And they never had time to react.

Why is there a secondary smaller opening? Having played Republic Commando since it came out, and seeing the troop bay doors completely shut in that one raised even further questions for me about it because the doors dont slide forward enough to seal that part. Of course in RC the bubble turrets attach through there, but in all other materials like the films, the turrets attach at the front of the main cabin itself. They even included the arch in the live action gunship in The Mandalorian season 3. The way TCW portrays the LAAT design makes more sense to me because instead of having a hole in your ship that is another thing to seal at high altitudes or in space, you just have a hard point to mount turrets or floodlights ",StarWars,46

Artifact - A short story,4/19/2025,1745063639,Artifact - A short story,"The trenches reeked of decay, burnt flesh, and the sharp, stinging bitterness of plasma discharge. I tightened my battered coat around my frame, shivering uncontrollably from cold, hunger, and exhaustion. This placeTeloth IV, once a verdant gem floating quietly among the starshad long since lost its beauty. Now it was just numbers, coordinates, endless rows of graves.

Why Teloth IV? Command told us it was vital. Hyperspace lanes, supply linesI suppose it made sense. But rumors whispered darker truths, strange artifacts buried deep beneath the once-proud city of Kal-Thara. I brushed off such tales as barracks lore, but I couldnt shake the unease crawling under my skin. It

Forward! someone shouted, a voice devoid of passion, like a hollow echo through broken glass. My squad stumbled onward, boots dragging through muck and gore, stepping over the lifeless husks of men whose faces were mirrors reflecting my own creeping despair. How long had we fought here? Weeks melted into months, maybe years, turning youthful hope into cynical resignation.

The enemy was brutala twisted alliance of gleaming, merciless machines and savage, reptilian monstrosities known as Krishal. Every yard gained was paid for in blood and sanity. We advanced nonetheless, pushed forward by something deeper than orders, something darker and unknowable.

Then came the summons.

I was called to deliver a sealed message to General Caedus, buried deep within the earth, beneath layers of rock and reinforced steel. The tunnel to his quarters hummed with a foreboding pulse, dim lights flickering like dying heartbeats. Approaching the heavy door, an unnatural chill sank into my bones.

Inside, whispers coiled around me like intangible serpents, soft and insidious, accompanied by a faint crimson glow. General Caedus, once composed and unshakeable, hunched trembling over a pyramid-shaped artifact that pulsed gently in his grasp. He jumped at my entry, fumbling and dropping the artifact onto his desk. It flashed open brieflyunfolding in impossible geometries, etched with glowing symbols that twisted my stomach with their alien wrongnessand suddenly the whispers turned to deafening screams, echoing inside my skull with unbearable intensity. All at once, every trace of heat drained from the room, leaving only bone-deep cold. Pain erupted behind my eyes, sharp and relentless, as if my skull might split open, before Caedus slammed the artifact shut, his eyes wide and haunted.

Sergeant, Caedus croaked, voice cracking, recovering swiftly. Your message.

I handed it over, unable to tear my gaze from that artifactsmooth, black as midnight, inscribed with symbols that seemed to writhe just beyond focus.

Dismissed, he barked, sweat gleaming like frost on his pale forehead.

Days dragged on, battles merging into a waking nightmare. Sleep brought no peacevisions haunted me, shadows whispering of horrors beneath Kal-Thara, promising madness. Then, abruptly, silence swallowed everything. Gunfire ceased, screams vanished. Kal-Thara fell eerily quiet, waiting like a predator in ambush.

We entered cautiously, my heartbeat drumming painfully. The city lay in ruin, drenched in gore, a grotesque tapestry of torn flesh and shattered metal. The Krishal and their machines had butchered each other, driven by some inexplicable madness. Unease settled heavy in our bones as darkness fell.

Night brought freezing terror. Shadows writhed like living things, whispering dreadful promises. Then, screams erupted, gunfire spat uselessly into encroaching darkness before silence reclaimed its terrible throne.

They emerged from shadows, cloaked figures moving with inhuman grace, wielding blades glowing like bloody stars. My comrades fell swiftly, brutally, unable to defend against beings who seemed less flesh than nightmare.

Frozen, I watched helplessly as they encircled General Caedus, now trembling and broken. They spoke to him softlywords I could not understand but felt viscerally, oily whispers dripping with vile promises and commands. With agonizing slowness, Caedus reached for the artifact, surrendering it willingly, face contorted in silent screams.

Then came the horror. Compelled by unseen hands, Caedus raised his fingers to his eyes, tearing them free with methodical, dreadful precision. Teeth and tongue followed, stripped from his body in a grisly display of obedience. Finally, he peeled away his own skin, leaving only a raw, monstrous husk collapsing lifelessly to the cold stone floor.

I was seized thennot by hands, but by something intangible and overwhelming, a monstrous will crawling into my mind. Welcome, servant, a voice whispered within my skull, gentle yet hideous, a force I could neither fight nor comprehend.

I watched, screaming silently within my own stolen flesh, as I moved obediently toward their waiting shuttle. They guided me like a marionette away from Teloth IV, away from its ruin and despair, into the blackness of spacea puppet, trapped forever in service to an unknowable darkness.",StarWars,2
Is the Dark Side truly more powerful or just the Force used without restraint?,4/17/2025,1744894304,Is the Dark Side truly more powerful or just the Force used without restraint?,"Just recently i played through the Jedi (Fallen Order and Survivor) games again.

Spoilers about Jedi Survivors: &gt;!Cal uses the dark side at pivotal moments to turn the tide in favor of the Light side.!&lt;

This made me question if the dark side is really evil in itself, or just a ""shortcut"" to power, skipping all sort of rational thought.

I know that its often painted as ""more powerful"" ,but what if thats not all there is?

What if the power isnt inherently dark - but its just that using the Force to its full, raw potential comes with serious risks?

From what we see in the films and especially with characters like Anakin, the Dark Side feels more like a shortcut than a different kind of power.

Its quick, emotional, instinctive.

Instead of thinking, evaluating, and acting with balance, the Dark Side is about immediate action through raw emotion, fueled by anger, fear, pain. Its absolutely unstable and corruptive - because solving your problems by sheer overpowering may feel ecstatic and the solution to all your problems.

So maybe the Dark Side isnt just about tapping into a different energy, but just about skipping the checks and balances that normally come with responsible use of the Force. Like ~~Palpatine~~  Yoda said, its ""quicker, easier, more seductive"" - not stronger.

In that sense, wielding the Dark Side isn't inherently evil - it's just super dangerous being fueled by hate, fear, grief and anger because it can consume you.

But under extreme circumstances, wouldnt it make sense for a Jedi to occasionally draw on that power? As long as they dont let it define them?

This may be a slippery slope though, because where do you draw the line where it goes from ""using it as a benefit to all"" to being over done and corrupting you without you noticing.

Could a Jedi responsibly use the darker side of the Force in rare moments without falling? I am not sure if i know about any characters that are known to be very good tapping into the dark side at all, like yoda or Obi Wan. Although now that i think about it, i believe there is always the moment of a short tap into the dark side in any jedis life.",StarWars,85

I feel very disappointed that Revenge of the Sith will not be re-released in my country,4/27/2025,1745747202,I feel very disappointed that Revenge of the Sith will not be re-released in my country,"Hello everyone.

I am an Italian fan, and I would like to share my disappointment. As all of you know, Revenge of the Sith is being re-released in theatres around the world to celebrate its 20th anniversary. I was genuinely excited about this, because Revenge of the Sith has always been my favorite movie of the entire saga, and I never had the opportunity to see it on the big screen. Watching it at home is enjoyable, but it is simply not the same experience as seeing it in a theatre, with that incredible sound, the atmosphere, and the full immersion that only a theatre can provide.

Unfortunately, here in Italy, the re-release will not happen. And honestly, I had already suspected that this could be the case. In Italy, Star Wars movies are never re-released in theatres for anniversaries. For example, last year The Phantom Menace was not brought back for its 25th anniversary, even though it was in many other countries. So I was kind of preparing myself for the worst, but deep down, I was still hoping that maybe this time it would be different. Especially because it is Revenge of the Sith, and it means so much to me.

But unfortunately, it has been confirmed that it will not be shown in Italian theatres, apparently due to issues with distribution rights, and whatever the real reason is, it does not make it hurt any less. Meanwhile, the rest of the world gets to celebrate this incredible movie the way it deserves, and we are just left behind. It is incredibly frustrating, and I feel both cheated and abandoned. 

We, the fans here, are always treated like we do not matter at all. We never get re-releases, special screenings, events, and we are not getting any celebration for such an important milestone. It makes me really sad and bitter, because I really wanted this. I have been dreaming about this moment for years, and now it is just taken away for reasons completely out of our control. As Anakin would say, ""it's outrageous! It's unfair!""",StarWars,17

Has it also saved yours?",4/24/2025,1745538220,"Star Wars has saved my life, and is one of the few reasons I am still here today. Has it also saved yours?","My life collapsed last year due to a mental health crisis and Star Wars is one of the few reasons I am still here today. 

Last year, I had a severe mental breakdown that turned my life upside down. I suffered through a period of suicidal ideation that landed me in a mental facility, where I was diagnosed with several different disorders. Sadly, they put me on the wrong medication, and I went through a multi-month long manic period. During that time I was sleeping on the floor, and suffered from severe irritability that required multiple police visits. Eventually, during my mania I would find myself in a very bad legal and financial situation. More or less, after that period of time I have found myself at rock bottom, where I am slowly trying to crawl out of this situation. The humiliation, shame, and regret I feel for this period of my life is enough for me to not want it anymore. Each day is like walking on eggshells, where at any moment I might collapse into depressive and anxious thoughts. However, I am making slow progress. It is so difficult, and I feel for anyone else who has suffered through the same thing. Keep fighting!

Star Wars is one of the few things that has kept me going throughout this period of time. There is that beautiful sense of nostalgia that keeps me going, it reminds me of a more beautiful time of my life where I had hope. It is something I lack in my life now, and Star Wars always seems to be there to give it to me.

Star Wars is about hope, and fighting against an oppressive force. Sometimes that force is ourselves; Like we see in the story of Anakin Skywalker, where he fell to the dark side due to his own fears of losing the one he loved. As Darth Vader he did so many terrible things, yet he was still able to find redemption. Truly, that is an inspiring story.

The vastness of the story is inspiring, where so many different themes, genres, and media types exist. I happen to be a massive reader, and I own most of the Star Wars novels. Just losing myself in the universe has been so helpful. I love listening to the audiobooks and playing them as movies in my head. There were so many painful nights where I found solace in a story from a galaxy far far away. 

It was amazing watching Star Wars Celebration, and seeing so many fans together loving the same thing, supporting each other. It was amazing watching all of the news and new releases being discussed by the panelists. So much excitement, so much hope, so much beauty. It helps keep my distracted from the more negative parts of my life. It makes you want to live, to fight, to be inspired.

Though I still struggle, I know Star Wars is there to help me.",StarWars,18

Matthew Stover's Revenge of the Sith made me into a believer,4/20/2025,1745176977,Matthew Stover's Revenge of the Sith made me into a believer,"I've always been someone who was very critical of the prequel films. I know for a lot of people, especially those who saw them as kids, they hold a special place in their hearts, but I could never really get past their numerous flaws in terms of writing, directing, and acting. Despite this, I've still managed to enjoy a lot of the expanded universe content set during that period. This includes novels like Shatterpoint and (most of) the Clone Wars TV show.

Out of the three actual films, Revenge of the Sith is often pointed to as the strongest, and on that point I'd agree. However, I would not go so far as some people in saying that it's as good as the originals. In fact, it still has many of the same problems as its predecessors, albeit to a lesser degree. The acting and directing are still very flat outside of a handful of memorable scenes, and the script fails to really sell Anakin's downfall, which is supposedly the whole point of the trilogy.

Matthew Stover's novelization fixes pretty much all of that and makes it into one of my very favorite Star Wars stories. Obviously, being a book, visual directing and line delivery are no longer a concern, but it goes so much further than that. Unlike many novelizations, it's not simply ""the movie script, but in prose"". It greatly expands upon the characters' thoughts, motivations, and even the events themselves. Stover was given a surprising amount of creative freedom with this adaptation and utilizes it to the fullest.

Where film Anakin could often come across as whiny, overly petulant, and ready to join the dark side with only the slightest of justification, Stover beautifully depicts the tragedy of someone constantly being pulled in multiple directions by more (politically) powerful people than himself. It explores how, while he's personally extremely loyal and is the perfect person to act as a noble war hero, he has no aptitude for bigger picture politics which make him extremely susceptible to Palpatine's manipulations.

Speaking of Palpatine, his plan comes across as far more thought out here. Rather than relying on Anakin just making really dumb decisions (though Anakin does still do that), you see and understand how he is able to play every side against one another and instill a sense of distrust in Anakin's head. Everything just keeps building and building until you're right there with him when he just breaks at the revelation of who Sidious really is. It seems almost reasonable that he would be willing to listen to what he has to say.

It's just an all around great book, and possibly the best novel in either Star Wars Legends or Canon. Anakin is the lynchpin of the entire prequel saga, and this makes everything come together in a way that it never had before.

It's almost a shame there's not something for Attack of the Clones because then you'd pretty much have a hat trick for the entire prequel trilogy. Unlike RotS, I believe the first two films are more fundamentally flawed, but Darth Plagueis can almost take the place of Phantom Menace by covering all the important plot beats in a far more interesting story. Attack of the Clones unsurprisingly introduces a lot of big elements for the Clone Wars era; maybe someone could try and write it from Dooku's perspective or something where we see him building the Separatist movement.

Until then, I'll gladly add this to the stack of Star Wars media that vastly improve a very flawed set of movies.",StarWars,16

Finn has always been an instincts driven individual who prefers to trust his own intuition and the universe around him, which in turn makes him primed to use the Force in a similar manner. Soresu may offer similar intuition in regard to the Force, but Finn leans more into the aggressive style of fighting even with his development later in the series. His specialization in Ataru would mainly serve to bolster his agility and unarmed techniques while he would lean more into the mentality and blade work of Shii-Cho.

Andor is Top Tier,4/10/2025,1744258117,Andor is Top Tier,"Of all the Star Wars series, I would have to say Andor is one of my favorites, if not, my favorite. The character development, storyline, politics, struggles, and even the acting make it one of the best produced series in the modern Star Wars productions by Disney. 

Anyone feel the same or differently? Ive watched all of the original series and obviously the movies and Andor is still one of my favorites. Curious what you all think. ",StarWars,55
Andor is AWESOME,4/18/2025,1745013602,Andor is AWESOME,"Hi all,

Ive been putting off watching Andor for years now because, in my opinion the quality of Star Wars media has been on a decline recently and I felt I was losing my passion for Star Wars and I didnt really know if much could bring it back.

But with all the excitement for Andor season 2 and with some serious urging from friends, I decided to take the plunge and WOW!!!

I just finished episode 6 and Im nearly finished with episode 7 but this show is so incredible.

The plot is fascinating, the characters are amazingly-written and the visuals are GORGEOUS.

Especially that heist episode, and Skeen and it was just so obvious that someone put some good effort into the script and story.

And its so amazing despite no huge nostalgia bias.

I think with a few Star Wars projects recently, Ive personally been blinded to their quality by the characters in the show.

For example, if i take away how cool it was to see Kenobi and Ahsoka on screen again I think their respective shows were really quite subpar.

I dont quite know what caused, for me, this massive jump in quality between Star Wars projects?

If its the writers then I hope they get a fat paycheck for season 2.

Im sure Ill continue to enjoy Andor to the max and I hope you all enjoy Andor season 2 when it comes!!!",StarWars,34

Forgotten Stormtrooper Generation?,4/12/2025,1744419225,Forgotten Stormtrooper Generation?,"I recall something about Stormtroopers, but I dont know if it is actual. I think I once saw on Wookiepedia a previous generation of Stormtroopers that is from the Legends continuity. I recall it as almost visually identical to the main Stormtroopers, but with a different color scheme (orange, I think). For those who are not aware, there are multiple generations often accepted for the Stormtroopers and is usually based on the evolution of armor. The MAIN ones are as follows.
1. Mandalorian
2. Republic Trooper &amp;/or Sith Trooper (not referring to Episode IX)
3. Clone Trooper (Phase I, ARC, Phase II)(based on Mandalorian)
4. TK Trooper
5. Stormtrooper
6. Stormtrooper (First Order)
7. Sith Trooper

Of course, there are (arguably) many more generations besides these, but I am having trouble finding the generation Ive mentioned in the first paragraph. It is possible that I am misremembering and it does not exist, but I want to find it if it does.

How do characters always know exactly where on a planet to land?,3/30/2025,1743370304,How do characters always know exactly where on a planet to land?,"For as long as ive been watching the Star Wars franchise, one question I cant seem to shake is how the characters always seem to know exactly whats part of a planet theyre going to, or theyll arrive at a distance from it that can be easily traveled. Wheres the logic in that? To put it into perspective, if someone said they were going to Earth, thats way too vague. If what youre looking for is in Mexico, for example, what are the odds you dont touch down in South Korea? How do they always know where to go? 

I understand that some planets may not be fully inhabited, and maybe most of their land mass is not populated by intelligent species, but what about planets like Coruscant? How do characters always know exactly where to go? Is this ever explained or is it simply for plot convenience?",StarWars,81

"The Clone War is a great commentary on political apathy and addiction to ""normalcy""",4/6/2025,1743973621,"The Clone War is a great commentary on political apathy and addiction to ""normalcy""","I thought about this after a post earlier about who would win the Clone War if the Sith weren't pulling the strings. 

And its the Republic. By an incredibly wide margin, as in the CIS stands zero chance. 

The Republic has literal quadrillions of citizens and most of the manufacturing power in the galaxy. If they mobilized for war, recruited for the military or even entered conscription, it would be inconvenient but the war would be over in a few years at most. 

In fact, the Jedi reaction to finding out about the clones should have been ""thanks, but even several million clones is a laughably tiny army to wage a galactic war. They can be the shock troops or special forces for the billions we'll need to win.""

But the clones are very convenient. While the tiny slave army goes out and fights with some local self defense forces on the edge of civilization, the rest of the Republic can pretend things are normal. No conscription, no casualties with names, no real war time economy. 

The Republic sandbags itself to an insane degree to avoid general mobilization and the inconvenience of war, along with the economic headache. Its a great commentary on the preservation of ""normal"" and economic comfort leading to far worse outcomes. ",StarWars,5

At one point, Boba comes around the corner and Luke pulls his blaster, making some slight noise. Boba barely turns his head in Luke's direction, but otherwise doesn't react and keeps walking. Then when they round another corner and those troops leave with Han's Carbonite slab, Luke trails them only to find out Boba lingered behind and was waiting to ambush him. Luke is nearly incinerated because of Boba's cool thinking and tactics. 

I feel like it's become popular to be like ""Boba is kind of a chump"", but that mostly comes from his goofy portrayel in RotJ. In ESB he's silent, deadly, and smart, like a spider luring a fly into a trap, or a venemous snake waiting to strike.

I also have never read any books for more context just fyi, I'm just a first time watcher. 

I do feel that the hate for Hayden Christensen's acting is way too much however? Like yes it's a bit boring and cliche - however, He seems detached and vengeful the way that Darth Vader is depicted, a bit brash and angry. He was slave his whole life and saw value in Padme as somebody compassionate like his mother and when she died he literally committed a genocide - how is he ever meant to come back from that to be a Jedi?  He ends up doing it out of spite and misguided love because that's all he's ever known. He's afraid of loss and doesn't care what he puts on the line for it.

Also, he has seen how the fake promise side of the government works so his inference with his limited world view before joining an organized ""order"" that's basically a thinly veiled religion makes sense. 

I wish they'd made Padm<U+00E9> more complex because as somebody with her values she definitely seems like she would've dumped such a scrub a long time beforehand but I guess it's supposed to be a forbidden exciting love story in a sense. Unfortunately this seems to be the case for a lot of women in sci fi so I won't try to hate on it too much.

Okay, so in The Tenebrous Way, we learn that Darth Tenebrous failed attempt to latch his consciousness onto the body of his apprentice Darth Plagueis through his modified maxi-chlorians so that he could possess the Chosen Ones body sometime in the future ended with him being trapped in a (presumably) eternal time loop where Tenebrous relives his death over and over again in never-ending repetition, as shown by his remains being long mummified, indicating that the storys end takes place possibly decades - if not longer - after Tenebrous initial demise. 

But the thing is& the reaction Tenebrous had to his mummified corpse& the realisation he had of whats happening probably wouldnt have hit him at first. 

Lets say that the entire span of the events of The Tenebrous Way take place over the course of a few minutes, directly after Tenebrous death and him trying to force his way out of Plagueis body upon realising how badly his plan had failed. The first few times, Tenebrous corpse wouldve still been fresh - heck, Plagueis was probably still there when the loop happened the first, second or even third time, depending how long the loop takes to pan out before starting again. That means Tenebrous mightve initially still held out hope that he could escape whats happened - he mightve even attempted to contact Plagueis like he planned to do in the short story, only for it to fail as his apprentice leaves his masters corpse buried in the rubble. 

From there, Tenebrous response per loop probably became more and more severe each time it happened, as his corpse steadily rotted and eventually mummified over the course of the time that it was buried, undiscovered, with only Tenebrous disembodied consciousness to keep it company. Can you imagine what sort of responses Tenebrous wouldve had upon discovering the loop in each instance, outside of the one we got to see in the novel? What sort of reaction would he have afterwards, when his corpse has presumably crumbled to dust (assuming the loop maintains itself for that long)? Tenebrous may have been a despicable being, but the thought of undergoing what he did becomes ever-more horrifying when you have this realisation. ",StarWars,1

And it serves as a reminder that hype nostalgia is real.","I made this belated realization in the process of working double shifts to get money for May the 4th sales, rebinging *Andor* Szn 1 for the first time since 2022 to watch Szn 2, and yes, reading issues #49-77 of Dark Horses Republic comic series as a build-up to watching *Revenge of the Sith* for its 20th Anniversary in the theater over the weekend. Not to mention preparing to read *The Courtship of Princess Leia* in honor of two friends getting married on May the 4th. 

Its a lot on my plate, but then I realized that this trailer for another movie thats about to be a decade old turned a decade old itself, and that led me here. 

I still remember the day this trailer dropped. I saw some still images on Instagram as I was walking home from school one day during Sophomore year. I couldnt see the images well because it was sunny out so I ran home with my textbook laden book bag on my back. The first thing I did when I got home was plop down on the living room couch and played the trailer. 

The following two minutes of my life were even more memorable than the 90 seconds of footage that dropped five months prior on November 28th, 2014. 

The music in the trailer alone still gives me chills to this day. The stills above seemed to paint a picture of what to expect. 

Even after the movie came out on December 18th of that year, the build-up and hype were as great a memory as seeing the movie itself. Its a case of where the journey matters more than the destination.",StarWars,73

Id seen the originals from the 70s and 80s, but perhaps I was too young at the time to fully understand the complexity of the SW universe.

And so, when they were remastered and released - there was hype everywhere. Queues down the road for the cinema, people getting dressed up, merchandise flying everywhere - it was so addictive and huge.

And heres the thing - long story short (sorry) - me and my buddy were Star Wars mad at High School. We were talking about Vader one day and my buddy explicitly told be how he became Vader; he was severely disfigured because he almost burned to death on a planet made from Lava and he needed his suit and helmet to live.

Obviously this was almost 30 years ago but I remember him telling me verbatim. Although I read books at the time (there were loads around), I never came across any that described Anakins fate. 

Does anyone know how he may have known this detail so far in advance of 1, 2 and 3? He was a smart guy, but not a time traveller to the best of my understanding.

Andor is the best-written Star Wars show I've ever seen,4/16/2025,1744799674,Andor is the best-written Star Wars show I've ever seen,"I'm currently on my second rewatch and the show has no weak point. The dialogues are superb, the story is not exaggerated, which makes it believable, and every single character, now matter how minor, fits their role perfectly. I also like that there is much bigger focus on ordinary, common characters, basic workers or prisoners and their daily lives.

Kino Loy and Dedra Meero are my favorites, no matter what side they're on. Again, they're perfectly written and the actors did an amazing job portraying them. Syril Karn would be my third favorite, even though I barely remember his name. And that's actually a good thing, I adore the character without even knowing what his name was until my second rewatch! That already says a lot about how accessible the characters are. And the fourth one would be Maarva, just because of how pure and brave she is.

The focus on politics talk and small details, that other shows usually consider insignificant, such as the bookkeeping that Mon Mothma discusses with her childhood friend, make the show even more believable and intriguing.

What I also love about this show is that unlike many other Star Wars shows, it's not black and white (not dealing in absolutes), it's grey. Every single character can be liked and disliked, and I don't mean it in a way of their portrayal but their script and design in general. Cassian is not a superhero, hell he is not even a hero, he kills without hesitation if needed. Dedra is cruel, doesn't hesitate to torture people, yet she is completely cold and rational.



I wish I was able to speak English better and to express my thoughts with less vague words than those I used above, cause this show deserves it.

  
With all that being said, I can't imagine how difficult (or easy? I can't say) it was for the authors to produce something so plain, yet intriguing and make it interesting so that the viewers wouldn't get bored for even a second. Can't wait for the second season!",StarWars,64

My great realization during this screening of Revenge of the Sith,4/25/2025,1745564024,My great realization during this screening of Revenge of the Sith,"I was 8 when Revenge of the Sith came out. I saw it in theaters. Start Wars was everything to me, growing up. Over the last few nights, I rewatched 4, 5, 6, 1, and 2. Rewatching ROTS in theaters tonight made me realize that an enormous amount of my values, morals, and decision making, comes from my love of Star Wars and the Jedi order. From my sense of justice to doing the right thing, I am certain the Star Wars universe helped me become a better man. Subconsciously, when faced with difficult decisions, I try to think like a Jedi.

That being said, over the last couple of years, my heart was shattered and my whole world fell apart. My heart filled with hate and my life filled with problems. While watching this film tonight on the big screen again, with stunning visuals, powerful audio, and a genuine crowd, I realized that a great tragedy is just as beautiful as anything else in this world. The tragedy I experienced, is just as beautiful as a great victory. Thanks to this film tonight, I moved on in a single moment, something I was unable to do for years by myself.

Thank you for reading. There isnt much more to this other than to share my thoughts and a piece of my story. Im curious though to anyone who reads, what did Star Wars do for your life?",StarWars,37

Where was it ever said or implied that Luke hated Uncle Owen? Yes, in ANH, Luke was pretty frustrated that Owen wasn't letting him go off to the Imperial Academy, but to me, it doesn't seem so much that he hated Owen.

The Force is not Ying and Yang.,4/8/2025,1744103156,The Force is not Ying and Yang.,"Something that I was surprised to see in the Star Wars community since I got back into it was how many people are sympathizers of the dark side. Saying it can be used for good, or that it's misunderstood. That you need to have both light and dark to have balance.

But that's not the Force. According to Lucas, the existence of the dark side itself is what causes imbalance. The true nature of the Force is the light side. The dark side of the Force is a corrupt, perverted version of it.

It's like a drug or an infection. It will always corrupt. It was always leave you wanting more and never being satisfied. The dark side itself is the embodiment of selfishness.

While I understand that Lucas sometimes contradicts himself (there are even some things I disagree with him on), or that some of what he's envisioned for Star Wars has been retconned (especially concerning this topic). But I have immense respect for the man and this is his story. When it comes to the core principles of his story, I believe those need to be honored.

My only guess is to why this is even so much of a thing is that some people just find good and evil and objective morality boring in stories. I heavily disagree. 

Evil does need to exist to have balance in the universe. The choice to do evil is necessary for good to exist, but the state of it existing does not. That is what the dark side and light side truly are, not a Yin and Yang philosophy.

The dark side does not need to exist. As far as the Force is concerned, it shouldn't exist. And I'm kinda over people trying to romanticize it.",StarWars,268

That quiet moment said more than any lightsaber ever could.","I know the *Kenobi* series had its ups and downs depending on who you ask, but one moment that has really stuck with me  and honestly made me emotional  was when Obi-Wan finally says:

*Im sorry, Anakin.*  
And Vader responds:  
*I am not your failure, Obi-Wan. You didnt kill Anakin Skywalker& I did.*

That exchange hit harder than any duel. For Obi-Wan, it was closure. For Vader, it was a confirmation that Anakin is gone  or at least that he wants the galaxy to think so. For us as viewers, it retroactively deepens everything that came before.

The fact that the moment is so restrained  no flashy Force moves, no dramatic score swell, just two broken men confronting the past  made it even more powerful.

It reminded me that Star Wars has always been about personal choices, regrets, and redemption, not just space battles.

Tarkin really did seem to want Ahsoka to be proven guilty, perhaps so that Anakin could be pushed closer to the Dark Side, and Anakin was also the only Jedi that Tarkin seemed to respect.

Tarkin was also given a very high chain of command being in charge of the Death Star when The Empire was created.

It just seems weird that he wouldn't have known for at least a while that Palpatine was Darth Sidous the whole time.",StarWars,61

The Yuuzhan Vong and their connection to the Force,4/10/2025,1744270812,The Yuuzhan Vong and their connection to the Force,"
Something that irritated me a bit about how the New Jedi Order series handled the Yuuzhan Vong was the explanation for their absence in the Force. Books like the Edge of Victory duology and Traitor seem to imply that the Yuuzhan Vong are, in fact, connected to the Force - its just that the way theyre connected to the Force is so utterly alien and unlike anything else seen in the galaxy that the Jedi cant understand it, hence why they cant detect Yuuzhan Vong presences and why they need to invent the Vongsense technique. But The Final Prophecy and The Unifying Force go on to totally reject this very intriguing and thematic concept - since the series has a big emphasis on the Jedi re-evaluating their perceptions of the Force and their role in the galaxy - and instead says that the Yuuzhan Vong were just cut off from the Force by their homeworld. I feel like if theyd kept the first explanation as the definitive one, then the Yuuzhan Vong wouldnt be so controversial since they wouldnt break the lore in such a manner that theyre often accused of doing.

Both agree that there were 10,000 Jedi around the fall of the Republic. 

Legends also says that 100 quadrillion people in the galaxy. Thats 1 Jedi per 10 trillion people. So even if just 1000 Jedi survived Order 66, thats 1 Jedi per 100 billion people post the Purge. 

Putting that into perspective, the earth is around 8 billion people. Relating it to earth scale, thats about 1 Jedi to every 16 million people. Thats the population of a large metro area like New York City. Thats one person in the entire city that is special like that. 

Jedi were rare. Not seeing one in your entire lifetime was probably extremely common. And then for 20 years, no one even talks about them save for this one guy who killed the emperor and had a small school. 

One guy, in a galaxy of quadrillion peoples. Even 1,000 vs quadrillions is staggering. 

If you want it take it just to canon, City planets like coruscant exist. Coruscant alone counts near 1 trillion. 

Just putting that number into perspective. If you stacked 100 quadrillion dollar bills together, youd reach beyond alpha centari, the closest star system to us. Just one trillion dollar bills would reach 28% to the moon. And then, just 10,000 are Jedi. 

1000 Jedi isnt a lot. The scale of the galaxy isnt well explained. And after 20 or 40 years, theyre forgotten and placed as Myths because not only are they extremely rare, theyre being hunted and in hiding for 20 years.

Am I the only one geeking hard about this ship?,4/24/2025,1745506464,Am I the only one geeking hard about this ship?,"Guys, I'm positive the TIE Avenger have become my favorite starfighter in all of Star Wars!!

I know the T-65B X-wing is THE Star Wars Starfighter for excellence... But man oh man! The Avenger is just something else!!!

The Star Wars Galaxy should have better technology than ours on principle but more often than not I'm left disappointed with any design they come up with...

I'm aware Lucasfilms and ILM usually sticks with the worn down and old aesthetic George went for during the OT... But even 40 years later during the sequels the T-75 barely improve on the design at all!

Now the Avenger does show technology I'll expect from something designed to fight against other Starfighters. 

Where the regular TIE barely reach late 1 Gen fighter technology here on earth (something like a MiG-15) and the X-wing is significantly better but barely reaching 3rd Gen (Like the F-4 phantom)... The Avenger is clearly approaching 4th Gen maybe even 4++ (roughly like the F-15E)

* The Avenger is only the second Starfighter I've seen with a fully functional HUD (Heads Up Display) after the ARC-170 and paired up with its radar it does have decent situational awareness unlike every other TIE variant.

*The Avenger is controlled by a HOTAS (Hands on Throttle and Stick) instead of a traditional yoke so the pilot should be able to fully utilize most of the ships systems without getting their hands from the controls (though this HOTAS is inverted for some reason)

*The rotary blaster cannon is basically this universe version of the M61 Vulcan (the F-15, F-16, F/A-18 and F-22 internal cannon)

*And Finally an Starfighter that uses external pylons!!! I always wondered why they never hang rockets and missiles under the wings of their fighters since stealth has never been something the Rebellion nor the Empire had even though of integrating on their crafts

*Of course... They haven't even tried to depict Beyond Visual Range dogfights but this is a step in the right direction!!!

I hope they choose to follow upon this advancements in starfighter design whenever they decide to release the movies Star Wars: Starfighter and Rogue Squadron!

TLDR: Love the Avenger design and its features, it reminds me of Earth's 4th Gen fighter jets I loved so much!",StarWars,84

Why were were clone troopers deployed on open ground outside their armored transports at Geonosis?,4/5/2025,1743824496,Why were were clone troopers deployed on open ground outside their armored transports at Geonosis?,"First of all, I know that the *real* reason we see clones and battle droids on the ground in the movie is for the spectacle...because it's a movie. The writers and SFX artists were not tacticians. But for the sake of argument, what is the in-universe, strategic reason for having ""boots on the ground"" in the open at Geonosis?

My understanding is that the Republic had two primary goals at Geonosis: 1) Prevent the CIS core ships from escaping, and 2) Capture the droid factories.

To prevent the core ships from escaping, the Republic deployed the laser-artillery walkers on the ground, which were the most effective weapon they had in their arsenal to bring down the core ships. However, the laser-artillery walkers were vulnerable to the spider-droids, roller-droids, and other ""armored assault vehicles"" being thrown at them by the Separatists. To protect the laser-artillery walkers, the Republic had gunships drop AT-TE walkers on the ground, which served the dual purpose of protecting the laser-artillery walkers and getting clone troops closer to the droid factories to capture them.

The AT-TE wallers and Republic gunships seemed to function like their real-world equivalents of armored fighting vehicles (AFV's) and attack helicopters, respectively. The AT-TE's, like AFV's, protected the artillery while maneuvering troops toward strategic points to capture. Meanwhile, the Republic gunships, like attack helicopters, provided support from the air, although they could not destroy *that many* enemy ground units due to their light armament.

It is at this point that I ask why the Republic deployed clone troopers on the ground *before* the AT-TE walkers had reached the droid factories. Despite the number of CIS droids attacking the laser-artillery walkers, I would think that there is *no reason* that the combined armaments of both the AT-TE walkers assaulting across open terrain and the Republic gunships supporting them from the air could not have destroyed ALL enemy battle droids. Why put troops on the ground in open terrain, thus exposing them to being *literally blown up* by all the heavy weapons coming their way? Why not leave them inside the protective armor of the AT-TE's until they reached the droid factory capture points?

In this respect, it would seem that the Battle of Hoth from ESB made a lot more sense: we didn't see Imperial stormtroopers deploy from the AT-AT's until they had reached the Rebel base for breaching. In the movie, as in real life, the AT-AT ""armored fighting vehicles"" protected troops during the advance across open terrain *and* had adequate armaments to fend off the Rebel speeders. At Geonosis, however, basic strategic reasoning that anyone can understand, whether or not they study real warfare, seemed *not* to be followed!

What do.you think is the reason? Am I missing something? Again, I know it""s ""just a movie,"" but the abillity of Star Wars fandom to create reasonable in-universe explanations is unparalleled.",StarWars,79

Obi Wan Rewatch - The Hate is Overblown,3/31/2025,1743398294,Obi Wan Rewatch - The Hate is Overblown,"I just finished rewatching Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I just gotta say, I truly dont get the hate this show gets. Im not blind to the faults, Leia hiding under Kenobis skirt being the most egregious of all, well no actually definitely Reva running around after getting impaled by Vader. Theres faults. But theres so much greatness and beauty in it, this shot in particular won over my heart entirely. Obi-Wans entire relationship with Leia was so beautiful, the way he looks at her was enough to make me tear up. 

Hayden, although underused was grandiose and lethal and gave us probably one of the best Vader moments in recent memory. The way he stopped that ship mid air and tore through Reva without even DIGNIFYING her by igniting his own lightsaber and wiping the floor with her OWN lightsaber, the Anakin sass and disrespect was strong with that scene.  

I loved the climax of Obi-wans journey of rediscovering the light and continuing in its path after the events of Order 66 being Qui-Gon telling him ""I was always here, Obi-Wan. You just were not ready to see."" 

I could say more but I wanted to keep this post brief and see what the consensus on the show is nowadays, but for me, although flawed, its great and awesome!

Why I dislike the reinserted Jabba scene in A New Hope,4/14/2025,1744665317,Why I dislike the reinserted Jabba scene in A New Hope,"""There is no terror in the bang, only in anticipation of it"". <U+00A0>- Alfred Hitchcock

Hitchcock understood that what the audience imagines is often more powerful than anything you can show. Thats why I think putting the Jabba scene back into A New Hope was a mistakeno matter how good the CGI Jabba got.

Filmmakers, like any artists, can get fixated on details that feel essential to them but don't actually matteror even registerfor the audience. Whats interesting is that the updated Greedo scene does a better job selling the danger of Jabbas bounty, and it does it by leaving Jabba himself to the imagination.

As a kid, having to wait in suspense until the third film to finally see this gangster Jabbawhod been looming over Han for two whole movieswas an unforgettable payoff. It was a buildup you could only experience once.

Anyway, thats just how I see it. Im sure plenty of people would disagree, but I think theres an objective storytelling principle at playone that Lucas stumbled into out of budget constraints, but that ended up serving the story better than his original idea. Any artist knows this kind of thing happens all the time. The real skill is in recognizing when the limitation actually made the work stronger.

Admiral Ackbar will return in a much, much bigger way, and is ""going to go head to head with Thrawn.""  
It took all my effort to resist writing the line \[it's a trap!\],"" Filoni said. ""Because Im like, I cant do that. That would be so lame. This guy cant always get into the trap. Youd think he would see it this time! So theres no way you can trap him again.

Hayden Christensen will be reprising his role as Anakin Skywalker. No details were given.

Zeb will be a part of the New Republic going up against Thrawn's forces.

Season 2 was predictably a big challenge because of losing Ray, said Filoni. I knew Ray from working on voice acting with him, he said, It was a challenge for me to consider continuing for a while. But I have a wonderful support group in Jon (Favreau) and Rosario (Dawson).

I found a way in  I had Ray in my head. Im grateful for all my conversations with him about Baylan. So, I understood what to do, it just took a while to get there. Im very confident now that Ray would be happy with the direction that weve chosen, added Filoni who made the decision in concert with the late actors family.

The character is meant to be the parallel to Ahsoka in every way. If theres a light, theres a dark, and Baylan is representing a different journey for a Jedi as you (Rosario) represent one who walked away from the (Jedi) order, so did he. Thats a parallel that must continue, said Filoni.",StarWars,158

The story behind George Lucas rewriting/reshooting Anakins turn to the dark side after principal photography had concluded on Revenge of the Sith,4/26/2025,1745703501,The story behind George Lucas rewriting/reshooting Anakins turn to the dark side after principal photography had concluded on Revenge of the Sith,"Taken from Secret History of Star Wars using Rinzlers Making of RotS book as a source:

&gt; By now it was well into November of 2002, with production scheduled for the next summer, but Lucas was still having trouble tying together*Episode III's*still-changing story. By December he had still not starting scripting--nor even an outline of the film.*(v)*However, sometime in January, Lucas finally wrote a brief, 55-page rough draft that layed out how the film would unfold.*(vi)*In this draft, Anakin's turn is slightly different--his dream of Padme is that she is consumed by flames and not dying in childbirth, and Anakin's siding with Palpatine is given an enormous twist in that Palpatine reveals that he is, in fact, Anakin's father.*By June, principle photography had commenced.

The turn, as originally written and filmed, played out in a drastically different manner than what is seen in the final film. But first, we should first examine the nature of Anakin's turn itself, hinted at earlier.The original conception of Anakin's turn was that the darkside was slowly turning and corrupting his mind, like some kind of drug or virus. Anakin's massacre of the Tusken Raiders was initially a pivotal point (in many other ways as well, as we will see later) because it gave him his first taste of this awesome power, and slowly but surely he would be drawn back to it. Thus, when Anakin struck down Mace (or Dooku, in the original conception), it was the consumation of a journey that began in Episode II. This is why the Emperor was sure Luke would fall in**Return of the Jedi**if he killed Vader out of hate--once you had tasted its power, it would be so irresistable that you would inevitably be drawn back to it, and slowly it would consume you, twisting your mind. ""If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi Wan's apprentice,"" Yoda intones in**Empire Strikes Back*.*The Emperor had been so consumed in mind that it had even corrupted his flesh. But just as this aspect would be revised so too would the pschological aspect--but it would occur after the movie had been filmed.*As Lucas has also said, most bad people act on good faith, and here Anakin truely believed in the actions he was taking, that they were ultimately for a greater good, another aspect to be altered in the final cut.

The following is a summation of Anakin's turn as originally written and filmed:*Palpatine reveals his true identity to Anakin, telling him that the Jedi are planning to take over the Republic and to accept the Sith and the darkside. Anakin is conflicted but distrusts the Jedi--his mind is being influenced by the darkside already and he chooses to stay with Palpatine, essentially accepting the Sith in this scene. Mace and the Jedi then enter Palpatine's office--with Anakin present beside Palpatine. Mace tells Anakin to get behind him but Anakin remains where he is. When the Jedi ignite their lightsabers to arrest him, Palpatine uses the Force to retrieve Anakin's lightsaber and the fight begins. Anakin watches as his two mentors fight, and as Palpatine is disarmed he unleashes the Force-lightning. Mace and Palpatine struggle, and Palpatine's face is drained of his visage in the effort to sustain the lightning. Finally, as the two masters remain locked in a standstill, Anakin cuts off Mace's hand, and Palpatine fries him and sends him out the window. Anakin collapses in disbelief that the Jedi were indeed attempting to take over the Republic, and Sidious knights him, telling him to go kill the rest of the Jedi before they retaliate.
  
This is what appeared in the film when a rough cut was assembled in 2004. Seeking to gauge the film, Lucas showed this cut to a number of people, most of whom expressed some concern or confusion over Anakin's motivation for giving in to the darkside. ""Some people were having a hard time with*the reason Anakin goes bad,"" Lucas says. ""Somebody asked whether somebody could kill Anakin's best friend, so that he gets really angry. They wanted a real betrayal, such as 'you tried to kill me now I'm going to kill you.' They didn't understand that Anakin is simply greedy. There is no revenge. The revenge of the Sith is Palpatine.""*(vii)*Arguably, Lucas hadn't clearly developed this element of Anakin's pyschology.*However, while Lucas did not initially instigate as drastic changes as some suggested, he would soon change his mind from his first instinct, which was to leave the film as is. While editing the film down further, Lucas began to realise that the through-line of the picture was Anakin, and that any scene not directly related to him be exercised. The removal of these superfluous scenes unexpectedly began to shift emphasis towards the character's obsession for Padme, which Lucas then began to actively re-structure the film around, because, as he says, it seemed ""poetic."" Anakin would go to the darkside to save Padme, with his attempts to prevent her death ultimately killing her, in the vein of**Macbeth*. He says:*

""The first script I wrote had stories for everybody...and I cut it down and we had a script. But when we cut it together, there were still problems. Finally, I said, 'Okay, let's be even more hard-nosed here and take out every scene that doesn't have anything to do with Anakin.' But that causes you to juxtapose certain scenes that you were never contemplating juxtaposing before. And these scenes take on different qualities than before, because the scenes were never meant to be next to each other...What happens then is that some of the themes grab hold of each other and really strengthen themselves in ways that are fascinating...so we'll strengthen that theme because it seems poetic.""*(viii)

First, a second vision of Padme's death was inserted. This vision was not scripted but created in the editing--taking footage from the end of the film (which appears in the shooting script, ie Obi Wan saying ""hold on Padme"") and splicing it into a scene where Anakin sits staring off in thought in Padme's apartment. This is then a more metaphorical ""vision"" and not a literal dream as the first one was. Originally this scene was preceeded by one in which Obi Wan actually does visit Padme--a scene prior to that one then had Palpatine planting seeds of jealousy in Anakin's head. So, you have 1) a scene where Palpatine suggests Padme is hiding a secret, 2) a scene where Obi Wan secretly meets with Padme, which is then followed by 3) the scene of Anakin in Padme's apartment. The scene then plays out in that he shows paranoia first, then confesses he has been lusting for power, and then finally says he will find a way to save Padme. Here we see the original configuration of Anakin's turn in which there are many causes--we see here Palpatine and the darkside corrupting his mind, creating paranoia and building within him a thirst for power, and finally we have it punctuated with a need to save Padme. But with the elimination of the two preceeding scenes and the insertion of the waking vision, the scene plays out with a singular focus: saving Padme.

Two rounds of pick-up shooting then occured which actively re-wrote the film to reflect this new arc surrounding Padme. While in the original film it was just one of many issues relating to Anakin's fall, here it now became**the**issue. Anakin would instead turn to the darkside out of an act of misplaced love--no longer would he be corrupted by evil, and no longer would he betray the Jedi; his turn would be linked to a spontaneous emotional reaction to save Padme.

First, a scene was added in which Anakin consults with Yoda over his visions. Here Yoda call them ""premonitions""--not only was the single dream reprised with the edit trick, it was now referred to in the plural long before this, implying Anakin is regularly tormented by them, enlarging his obssession with preventing them. Then, the entire ""turn"" sequence was re-written.

Here, Anakin would not ""turn"" to the darkside; newly shot material has Palpatine swaying Anakin away from the Jedi and emphasizes the power to save Padme when he reveals his Sith identity-- however, Anakin would instead reject Palpatine's offer and stay loyal to the Jedi. He then goes to Mace Windu and tells him about Palpatine. Windu tells Anakin to wait in the Jedi council chamber while he takes a squad of Jedi to arrest the chancellor. As Anakin waits in the chamber, Palpatine's telepathic thoughts echo to him stating that if the Jedi kill him, Padme will die. Anakin rises and he and Padme tearfully gaze at each other from across the city--Anakin knows he must prevent Palpatine from being killed if he is to save her. He runs to a speeder and arrives just as it seems Mace has beaten the Dark Lord. Palpatine begs Anakin to help him as he shoots lightning at Mace, saying he has the power to save Padme. Finally, Anakin speaks up--""you can't,"" he tell Mace as Mace is about to do him in. ""I need him!""*As Mace's sabre comes down Anakin intercepts him, cutting off his hand, and Palpatine sends him out the*window. ""What have I done!"" Anakin exclaims, collapsing to the ground. ""Just help me save Padme's life,""*he says, kneeling. ""I can't live without her."" Sidious then*knights him as Anakin looks away regretfully.

All of this material was added to the film in the editing phase.*Anakin would now accept the darkside because it (incidentally) contained a power to save his wife. Though this massive re-write does, however, raise a major curiosity in that Anakin inexplicitly agrees to kill his extended family, the Jedi, even when he was loyal to them moments before when he turns Palpatine over to Mace Windu. Now Anakin was no longer corrupted by the darkside and no longer believed the Jedi were evil and attempting a devious plot to take over the Republic. Anakin's massacre of the Tusken Raiders in Episode II was obviously placed there to foreshadow this plot point--killing even the women and children because he believed they deserved it. Now, however, he didn't believe the Jedi deserved it at all (at this point in the story, at least). There are still remnants from the original version of the storyline in the final edit, mostly in the latter stages of the film. ""Twisted by the darkside, young Skywalker has become,"" Yoda says, in reference to the original version where Anakin had slowly been consumed by it. ""The boy you trained, gone is he, consumed by Darth Vader."" Later in the film, Anakin reflects his original belief that the Jedi were evil traitors--""I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over...from my point of view, the Jedi are evil!"" This no longer was valid, especially now that it was Anakin himself who turns Palpatine over for the Jedi to arrest and/or kill. It may be argued that, given the enormous manner in which the film was broken apart, re-written and then stitched back together--*after**principle photography--the film could not be totally re-assembled because it was written under a totally opposed conception of the plot and character. Lucas had re-written most of the first half of the film, but May 2005 was drawing closer, and there was not enough time to coherantly re-align the entire plot of the film.

Nonetheless, we see here how evanescent the storyline was--even the very sequence that is arguably the heart of the entire trilogy. ""The only scene I hadn't thought through enough is the \[turn scene\],"" Lucas says to Sam Jackson and Ian McDiarmid during the 2004 re-shoots.*(ix)*Lucas explains his new conception of the turn to Christensen the next day: ""It's basically**Faust**in the end,"" Lucas says. ""Where you make a pact with the devil. And that usually leads to the same end: You cannot change the inevitable. If you try, you're basically going against the cosmos or however you want to define that.""*(x)

Qui gon melting through the blast doors in Star Wars lore,4/13/2025,1744504201,Qui gon melting through the blast doors in Star Wars lore,"Hey nerds, as someone who has grown up with Star Wars this was a defining moment for me. - background- I was 14 (?) At the release of Star Wars I: the phantom menace. After consuming every Star Wars piece of entertainment in my young childhood I was ready for this movie- I wanted to see how it all started! One of the most eye opening but most underrated lightsaber moments in The Phantom Menace is when Qui-Gon starts melting through the blast doors. Its easy to miss, but it actually says a lot about how lightsabers arent just weaponstheyre tools that have limits. They are not perfect energy swords that cut through everything like Swiss cheese, they have limitations outside another lightsaber.

In the games (and definitely the mandalorian)
I think they dig deeper into what the limits of what a lightsaber can and cant do. 
Thats all I just wanted to say how wild that was for me as a kid. For those who havent been watching Star Wars since the 90s- was there a moment like that for you?

He said he had to keep discussions like that secret.

Ive rewatched this fight more times than Ive had actual meaningful conversations with people. Duel of the Fates kicks in, the doors open, and theres Maul just standing there like the final boss of every childhood nightmare. Double-bladed saber ignites and my brain still short-circuits.

The pacing? Chefs kiss. The choreography? Actually feels like skilled warriors fighting for their lives, not just spinning glowsticks for the camera. Obi-Wans raw emotion after Qui-Gon goes down? Brutal. Mauls whole vibe? Cold, calculated, completely menacing.

Andor Is Boring - The Importance of Media Literacy (No Spoilers),4/23/2025,1745432297,Andor Is Boring - The Importance of Media Literacy (No Spoilers),"With the release of the new season I feel the need to talk about this. 

Im not saying this to be disrespectful or offensive, but I need to get out my frustrations about the lack of media literacy when it comes to Andor. This isnt an insult, its just my observation on how people interpret this show and how I see a clear lack of thought to it. 

If you have problems with Andor thats totally fine, but most of the issues I hear is that its boring and slow. I hear people talk about how they dont like the long conversations, and things dont make sense. 

And to me thats a shame. Andor is chock full of subtext and character interactions which are written in a way that forces you to *think* about what they mean instead of taking it at face value. Dialogue is double sided, intentions arent always clear, motivations are disguised, and exposition isnt thrown in your face. Things dont make sense unless you actually take the time to understand what is going on internally. 

In the age of Marvel, and honestly a lot of Star Wars shows (and Im not saying everything is bad), most things are shown to *make use feel* without thought. Andor forces you to *think* about the characters to then feel. Set ups arent instantly payed off and theres no cheap throw ins or sloppy dialogue without meaning. 

I find character interactions *riveting*. The puzzle of understanding who a character is without them explicitly telling you is a staple of good writing to me. Yes, theres a lot of talking, but to say the talking makes it boring is a tell to me that you might not be thinking about what is happening. Scenes arent a means to an end, they are supposed to serve a purpose in progressing the story in a meaningful way. 

Are there things I dislike about the show? Of course, nothing is perfect and I dont like every decision, but the attention to detail on every piece of dialogue, character motivation, and story telling is phenomenal.

To those who say this is boring, next time you watch this show I urge you to not *feel* but to *think*. 

Edit: I want to make it clear its fine if you personally find this show boring. I take issue with critiquing the show as objectively boring due to your personal preferences. Enjoy whatever the hell you want to enjoy, but if youre going to make aesthetic criticisms on something you ought to have a thought out take, otherwise it comes off as media illiteracy. 

Edit2: damn some of yall are really mad by this and taking it extremely personally. Sorry not sorry? Imma stop interacting since this is getting pretty toxic and I gotta go live my day. Enjoy the Star Wars you like, dislike the stuff you dislike, I wont stop you. ",StarWars,829
