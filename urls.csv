"2023-02-24",1677235698,"Could Tesla Mexico revive this 2015 Lithium Supply Deal or be the start of Tesla Mining?","On the cusp of the Tesla Investor day and [Tesla Mexico announcement](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mexicos-top-diplomat-says-met-with-tesla-brass-good-news-imminent-2023-02-14/) will Tesla get in to mining via the [Sonora Lithium clay project](https://www.cadenceminerals.com/projects/sonora-lithium-project/) and their ""just add salt"" patent?

# The 2015 Mexican lithium deal

Rare Earth Minerals - now Renamed Cadence Minerals (LSE:KDNC) jointly with Bacanora Lithium finalised a [conditional long-term lithium hydroxide supply agreement](http://irservices.netbuilder.com/ir/cadence/newsArticle.php?ST=REM&amp;id=1577496) with Tesla.

Ganfeng Lithium (a Tesla supplier) [purchased Bacanora Lithium](https://www.mining.com/bacanora-lithium-accepts-ganfengs-391-million-takeover-offer/) in 2021 Cadence Minerals owns 30% of several Tenements with Ore mined from those JV areas \~ 72 Kt LCE year 8-19 - this could however be brought forward as Ganfeng now plan to produce 50,000t of Lithium Hydroxide. The market does not yet appear to have realised that Cadence is a likely beneficiary of any deal, holding 16% of the lithium resource, because the media only mention Ganfeng and not the nature of the joint venture.

# Recent developments and nationalisation of Lithium

In 2022 a law was passed in Mexico to nationalise their lithium deposits, because the law cannot be applied retrospectively this left the Sonora Lithium project as the only advanced stage deposit in private ownership (a monopoly). Ganfeng confirmed their licenses are still valid and the stated that mine will go ahead as planned.

Shortly after this ""Chinas largest lithium producer said that an investment by Ford, GM or **Tesla** would help provide automakers with reliable supplies of lithium that can be easily shipped across the border to plants in the US.""

The 11 states that 'raise their hands' for the Tesla plant in Mexico

From north to south, governors and business leaders have presented their offers to have the facilities of the automotive manufacturer.

Sonora and its appeal to lithium

In a press conference with local media, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard mentioned that **another of Tesla's interests is Sonora, due to its lithium exploitation.**

# The ""Sonora Plan""

Mexico has founded a new company ""LitioMx"" to exploit lithium and last week [established a reserve area](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2023/02/20230220-mexico.html).

The Sonora Plan is Mexico's clean energy and EV strategy for attracting investment and at the heart of it is the Sonora Lithium project.

On Friday, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard told local media that the president would speak to Tesla CEO Elon Musk soon and confirmed that **the EV maker is interested in stepping up its presence in Mexico**.""Ebrard has confirmed that **Tesla has expressed its interest in actively participating in the Sonora Plan**""

[Source](https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/mexican-president-to-discuss-new-plant-location-with-tesla)

As part of the Sonora Plan Lithium produced in Mexico cannot be exported and therefore batteries must be produced locally.

# US Inflation Reduction Act to Benefit Mexican Automotive Industry

Mexicos Ministry of Economy (SE) celebrated that the approval of the USs Inflation Reduction Act did not discriminate against the manufacture of batteries and electric vehicles in North America.

Final assembly of clean vehicles qualifying for the tax credit will have to take place in North America, and critical minerals used in batteries, including lithium, are going to have to be sourced from either North America or U.S. trading partners. **Beginning in 2024**, minerals or components sourced from foreign entities of concern like Russia and China will make vehicles ineligible for subsidies.

From in 2024, 40% of critical minerals found in EV batteries will have to be extracted or processed in the United States or countries with which it has free trade agreements incl. Mexico.

This has pushed General Motors (GM) to invest $650 million to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada.

# Tesla Mining

Rumours are now swirling that Tesla is now ready to get in to the mining business - reportedly considering buying Brazil-based lithium miner Sigma Lithium, which is currently valued at $3 billion.

**Sigma Lithium is one of multiple mining options Tesla is exploring as it mulls its own refining, one source said.**

Elon Musk said last year that [Tesla might now get into the lithium mining business](https://electrek.co/2022/04/11/tesla-lithium-mining-business-price-surge/)

# LitioMX Connection

[Mexicos State-Owned Lithium Company Is Negotiating Partnerships With Private Firms](https://www.bloomberglinea.com/english/mexicos-state-owned-lithium-company-is-negotiating-partnerships-with-private-firms/)

Taddei said that in some cases, LitioMx can go it alone, but in others he recognizes that the company **lacks the capacity and technology, as in the exploitation of lithium clay deposits.**

Taddei declined to name the companies with which LitioMx is negotiating, but mentioned that it has spoken with companies involved across the supply chain, from exploratory companies to **those with patents for the lithium separation process**.

""the first lithium projects will start before the end of López Obradors six year term in **2024**.""

# March 1 Tesla Investor Day

At the Engineering HQ opening Musk commented:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=640&amp;v=oaUiZwEYhUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=640&amp;v=oaUiZwEYhUI)""investor day on March 1st coming up soon and it's going to be a sort of investor day that is not just for Tesla investors but kind of like investors in Earth and just sort of explaining how we get to a fully sustainable energy future and that people should have optimism and hope for the future that should not be we shouldn't be complacent but they should not feel that there's no hope for the future because there there absolutely is and you know along with the rest of Industry we're going to make it happen so I believe in the future""

Perhaps ""investors in Earth"" literally, hopefully there could be some mining announcements.

"2023-02-19",1676831568,"Tesla's Investor Day Prediction","My big prediction for Tesla's Investor Day will be an announcement stating all long-term retail investors will get top priority to Starlink IPO shares.

The reason behind my prediction stems from multiple tweets starting with Elon's tweet in Sept 2020 where he stated, ""We will probably IPO Starlink, but only several years in the future when revenue growth is smooth &amp; predictable. Public market does \*not\* like erratic cash flow haha. **Im a huge fan of small retail investors. Will make sure they get top priority. You can hold me to it.**"" (Source: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310672832783884290?lang=en](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310672832783884290?lang=en)) 

Another tweet in June 2021 Elon stated, ""At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. **Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference.** (Source: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407877220543180800?lang=en](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1407877220543180800?lang=en))

Lastly, Glen Shotwell stated earlier this month, ""Starlink satellite internet program had a cash flow positive quarter in 2022 &amp; will make money in 2023."" (Source: [https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starlink-cash-flow-positive-quarter-2022/](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-starlink-cash-flow-positive-quarter-2022/))

The execution of this process will be up in the air but I'll also take a stab at the execution part. My guess is he'll give dibs on all long-term retail shareholders (Could make it a set date where March 1st, 2023 is the end date?) and they could purchase the shares based off a one-to-one ratio of Starlink shares-to-Tesla shares. For ex, for every Tesla share you own you have the privilege to buy a Starlink share. This way, you wouldn't have short-term traders be able to buy up tons of Tesla stock just to gain access to Starlink shares.

Ultimately, he'd reward the long-term retail shareholders and avoid manipulation of institutional investors dumping IPO shares once lockout period expires. After ALL the FUD, Twitter, and more, Elon is going to pay it back to the real Tesla investors.","teslainvestorsclub",64,"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/116k87k/teslas_investor_day_prediction/"

For reference they generated nearly $4B last quarter and Giga Berlin cost around $5B. Moving foward they'll essentially have enough cash to pay outright a new factory with no debt every quarter!  Pause for a moment and let that settle in... It is crazy to think about...

Obviously they won't need that many factories so the question for many investors should be how will Tesla intend to utilize all that cash flow, and correspondingly what impact does that have for future valuation.   I'm curious to your thoughts....  What might we see in '23 or '24 as it relates to cash utilization that is new or different?  Several ideas below to jump start conversation:

1) Massive stock buybacks

2) Dividend payouts

3) Hostile Takeover / M&amp;A (whom &amp; acquisition case theory?)

4) Crazy increase in R&amp;D

"2023-03-08",1678304789,"Could Tesla's New EV Charging Network Boost Their Revenue by Billions?","&amp;#x200B;

[Goldman predictions on Tesla opening charging access](https://preview.redd.it/de9rhgtbfkma1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44fe69f69c041e5885755b1194cb958496b583dc)

The analysis by Goldman Sachs showed that Tesla's revenue could increase by billions of dollars. This is because Tesla's charging network is already the most extensive and reliable in the world, and opening it up to other EVs will make it an even more attractive option for EV drivers. It's worth noting that the Goldman Sachs analysis only used a quantity of chargers that was below the current number of Tesla chargers. This means that the revenue potential could be even higher than estimated, as Tesla continues to expand its charging network.

By opening up its charging network to all EVs, Tesla is not only creating a new revenue stream but directly interacting with their competitors customers, as they have to download the Tesla App and pay a membership fee. This could encourage non-Tesla EV owners to switch to a Tesla vehicle, which could further increase Tesla's market share in the EV industry. 

One of the biggest selling points of Tesla's charging network is the fact that it is about 25% cheaper per session than other EV charging networks. While the idea of paying a $12.99 monthly fee may seem costly at first, this price point is still feasible for the entire EV market. This could make Tesla's charging network the go-to charging solution for all EV drivers, not just Tesla owners.

Moreover, with the rollout of this technology, Tesla can tap into billions in federal subsidies, further increasing their revenue potential.

"2023-02-13",1676314150,"Source - Definitely a New Vehicle Reveal on March 1st","Spoke to my Tesla ""source"" who works as an engineer the company. The accuracy of what I heard may vary from truth as of course some things they aren't privy to and also might be injecting personal opinions. Here are my bullets notes of interest:  


* March 1st is definitely revealing a new vehicle. He hinted at it being the obvious thing (robotaxi capable is my take) and he's seen sketches of it. Based on his reactions, I'm betting this thing is going to blow our minds in some ways.
* Model 3 refresh is a separate thing.
* I tried to ask if this vehicle could also be a van, he just smiled and said you'll have to wait till March 1st.
* March 1st is more about battery supply than the actual vehicle.
* He thinks vehicle won't be produced for a few years as battery supply constrains everything.

**More interesting notes**  


* 4680 pack not bottom cooled because heat transfer is towards the top so not efficient
* Would like to top cool ideally but vary materials layers in front of cooling makes it less efficient than desired
* Every few years they experiment with plastic side cooling ribbons (vs metal?) because it would be cheaper, but it never works out
* California headquarters is moving from Deer Creek buildings to former HP buildings off of Page Mill Rd (closer to civilization). Tesla keeps taking over HP buildings as the latter shrinks more and more.

Tesla laid off 4% of employees in Buffalo as part of a performance review program. The employees were part of the Autopilot labeling team. Tesla is facing pressures of unionization (union campaign) and some suspect Tesla made this move to curtain any potential for this to gain traction. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. 360K RECALL**  
Tesla will be recalling 360,000 vehicles as part of a FSD issue as identified by the NHTSA.  


Elon says this is likely an OTA software update fix and a ""recall"" is an exaggeration on the matter. Investors seemed to have shrugged off this news during the week and seemingly sided with Elon as the stock closed in the green.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. SUPERCHARGHING OPEN IN US**  
According to the White House, Tesla will be opening part of its Supercharging Network to 3rd party cars. This will allow for at least 7,500 chargers available by 2024. 

In exchange, it looks like Tesla will be able to take advantage of that $7.5B incentive plan the government has going - so Tesla should be able to build new stations to account for this demand increase (hopefully).

&amp;#x200B;

**4. GIGA SHANGHAI PAUSE**  
Tesla is pausing production at Giga Shanghai until March to perform factory upgrades. This will impact production numbers short term but should help increase it longer term.

Rumors are that this is to account for some changes in a newer version of the Model 3 in China.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. MIC MODEL Y PRICE HIKE**  
The Made in China Model Y has seen a price hike of 2000 Yuan ($291 USD). Incremental price increase as Tesla constantly adjusts for demand.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. SIGMA LITHIUM ACQUISITION?**  
Rumors are circulating that Tesla may be getting ready for an acquisition of Sigma Lithium. The company is a Brazilian firm that does lithium mining, and the deal is expected to be around $3B.

Both parties have not commented on the rumors.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. ANALYST CHANGES**  
We just had one analyst change this week - Barclays with an OVERWEIGHT and $275PT!

"2023-02-12",1676219941,"Tesla summarized news for the week [Feb 12]"," Ross Gerber running for a seat at Tesla BOD. This and tons more news from this week on Tesla covered below. Tesla (TSLA) investors closed off the week with the stock closing **+2.05%** the last 5 days, which means it sits at **+82.14%** YTD. Here's this weeks news summary [(full article here)](https://news.thecompounder.co/tesla-news-feb-12-2023)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. ALL MODEL Y QUALIFY** It's official - all Model Y models in the US now qualify for the $7,500 EV rebate! As a result, Tesla has increased prices on some variants slightly - the Y Long Range increased by $1,500 and Y Performance went up $1,000.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. HERTZ FALLING SHORT** Hertz planned to purchase 100,000 Tesla's by now, but have only done 50,000 purchases. According to Bloomberg, Tesla only accounts for 11% of Hertz's current fleet, and they are well behind their goal (which was to have more than double this by end of 2022!).

This appears to just be a slower adoption (perhaps due to supply constraints from Tesla or perhaps due to Hertz's financial position), but they are still focused on hitting that goal of 100,000 Tesla's.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. COPS LOVE THE MODEL Y** The RCMP in Canada have added the Model Y to their cruiser fleet! The Westshore RCMP department is running a pilot program and this is the first (of hopefully) many Model Y's to join.

Meanwhile on the other side of the border, the Somerset police department released a Facebook post outlining their reasoning for getting a Model Y. The bottom line is that they expect cost savings of $84,000 over the span of 10 years - hard to say no to those kind of savings!

&amp;#x200B;

**4. #2 IN DENMARK AND #1 IN CALIFORNIA** Tesla is slowly taking over Europe - the Model Y is the #2 best selling car in January 2023.

Sales in Denmark increased 10.7% YoY, with 481 units. sold. Denmark is one of the more forward countries for EV adoption - with a whopping 21% of all sales being EV in January, and Tesla is capturing a huge part of this opportunity.

On the other side of the pond, Tesla's Model Y took the #1 spot in California, and the Model 3 took the #2 spot! Very strong start to the year for Tesla, worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. EUROPE - GET READY!** Tesla appears to be gearing up for launching their Insurance program in Europe. 

According to a job posting from Tesla, they are looking for positions in the Insurance Europe department, This is a positive sign that their program will expand to the continent soon.

Insurance can be a very lucrative segment for Tesla as they have full insight as to how each driver performs - and they can optimize premiums based on habits (thus reducing their risk and increasing their profits).

&amp;#x200B;

**6. MASTER PLAN 3** Elon tweeted that their upcoming Investor Day (March 1st) will reveal their Master Plan 3.

Giga Texas also is titled in this image posted by Elon, implying that Gigafactory's development (and announcements) are all but certain.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. SEMI FOR SUPERBOWL** Twitter user munybrr tweeted some pictures of a newly wrapped Tesla Semi that will be featured in the Superbowl this weekend.

The bright colours and sleek design of the Semi is sure to create some buzz with consumers - which is excellent marketing and awareness for Tesla.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. MEXICO CONFIRMS** Tesla is rumoured to be announcing a Giga Mexico factory soon, and we got confirmation from the President of Mexico that there's one of two locations that could be selected in Mexico - Neuvo Leon or Hidalgo.

This indirectly confirms plans for a Gigafactory!

No word on Tesla yet on this, however it's expected to be announced on their upcoming Investor Day in a few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**9. AUTOPILOT OFF THE HOOK** The NTSB has cleared Tesla's Autopilot of any fault in a fatal crash in Texas in 2021.

The determination of the crash was due to excessive speed and the driver losing control of the car - nothing to do with Autopilot.

This is a huge relief for Tesla as this brings it one step closer to getting full approval in the US eventually once FSD is fully released.

&amp;#x200B;

**10. OPEN THE SUPERCHARGERS** Tesla may need to open their Supercharging network to 3rd parties in the US if it wants to be eligible for the $7.5B Department of Transportation subsidy.  

This plan is aimed at improving EV charging infrastructure across the country and although not finalized, it appears Tesla may have to open the chargers or risk being left out of this essential ""free money"".

Tesla has been piloting opening their Supercharging network in other countries (Europe and Australia) so the US is likely coming soon.

&amp;#x200B;

**11. V4 COMING** Tesla's V4 Hardware got approval to be sold in Europe for Model S/X.

The V4 is suppose to be 4x better than V3 for FSD however details are still not finalized at this time (but coming soon!).

&amp;#x200B;

**12. ROSS GERBER BOD** Ross Gerber has announced he wants to join Tesla's Board of Directors (BOD).

This move is in an effort to steer Tesla in the right direction (in his eyes) and have influence over future business decisions Tesla makes. He is well known in the Tesla community and has built up a reputation of going a big Tesla supporter over the years.

&amp;#x200B;

**13. NEW LAWYER** Tesla has hired a new lawyer to join the team as they continue to work to strengthen their Legal department. Brandon Ehrhart (from Dish Network) is the newest member of the team.

Tesla has been facing constant legal issues around the world with regulations, approvals, etc., and Musk likely foresees this to only get worse over the years, so the focus is to make sure the right people are in place to help Tesla move forward with their mission and win legal battles.

&amp;#x200B;

**14. GIGA BERLIN HALTED** Tesla has been ordered to halt production on Solar Panels at Giga Berlin. 

The government of Germany claims that Tesla did not have approval to put down concrete stakes to get these panels installed. This is yet another bump in the road but Tesla will now work to get an approval here to move forward with their efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

**15. ANALYST CHANGES** 2 Analyst changes this week - Wedbush with $225PT and RBC Capital with $223PT - both with an Outperform rating.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it for this weeks TSLA news!

"2023-02-28",1677573112,"How Tesla could produce a car that costs 36.9% cheaper than a Toyota Camry. (And why it won't, yet.)","Like many (most?) of us, I believe that Investor Day will include an announcement of an inexpensive compact car.

I see happening for a few reasons:

1. I believe that demand is starting to fade a bit more than was expected with the federal tax credit.

2. This is the shortest path to 20 million cars by 2030.

3. This in preparation for RoboTaxi, acquiring more data for FSD, and with the goal of using pre-owned cars in that RoboTaxi network.

Next, the costs to build:

Musk said that the Model 2 would cost approximately half of the cost of the current line of cars. The current cost is about $38,000 [Source](https://ir.tesla.com/#quarterly-disclosure) .

That would put the costs on the order of $19,000. (I think this is low.)

I also think this is part of the reason for the announcements of Tesla planning on acquiring lithium mines. They are hoping to reduce their costs. This may also the reason they may be looking to open a gigafactory in Mexico.

Next, the sale price:

On Battery Day, Tesla ""pre-announced"" a compact car with a price of $25,000. Adjusted for inflation, that puts the price at about $28,700.

Factoring in the EV tax credit, that reduces the price to $21,200.

The profit on the car for Tesla would be 34%. That's why I'd estimate the cost of production will likely be higher than $19,000. I would guess it would be around $23,000. (Though I will explain why it might end up being closer to $19,000 later.) That still puts the profit at about 25%.

Now, the costs to lease:

**Toyota Camry**

Lease price of [$482](https://www.buyatoyota.com/westernwashington/payment-estimator/?series=camry&amp;year=2023&amp;zip=90210&amp;offer=camry_apr_f5c60269-671d-4ade-969e-d068b30ef9bc)

Fuel costs of $77 (800 mi/mo * (3.365$/gal.) / (35 mi/gal))

Oil costs of $8.50 (800 mi/mo * ( [$32](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/average-cost-oil-change-2023/) /oil change) / (3000mi/oil change)

That gives us a total of $567.50

**""Model 2""**

Lease cost of [$331](https://www.calculator.net/auto-lease-calculator.html?cloanamount=21200&amp;cmonthlypay=380&amp;cloanterm=36&amp;cratetype=interestrate&amp;cinterestrate=6&amp;cdownpayment=0&amp;ctradeinvalue=0&amp;csaletax=0&amp;cresidualvalue=12296&amp;printit=0&amp;ctype=standard&amp;x=76&amp;y=23)

*This assumes a valuation of 58% after 3 years. I believe this is VERY, VERY conservative, as the Model 3 has an assumed depreciation of 32%. However, I wasn't willing to give a compact car this low of a depreciation.*

*I honestly think that this lease price is WAY too high. Literally maybe $100 too high, but I wasn't willing to go less yet. 6% interest rate is too high, and 42% depreciation is too high. But I just can't bring myself to go under $300. Factor this in as you might.*

Energy cost of $27 (800 mi/mo * [$0.168](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices_selectedareas_table.htm) /kWh / 5 kWh/mi) 

Total cost would be $358.

This would save you $209.50, or 36.9% off the price of a Camry.

------------------

**Okay, now speculation time**

Okay, now, if you're Tesla, you're about to have a problem: You are going to announce a vehicle that will be a LOT cheaper than your current cars. And it might kill your current demand. Why would someone buy a Model 3 or Model Y now, when they can wait a few years, and get a Model 2 for so much less? After federal tax credits, it would literally be HALF the purchase price of a cheap Model 3.

And so, you risk hitting the [Osborne Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect), where people won't buy your current product when they expect your new one to be cheaper and/or better.

And let's be honest, the Model Y is almost as good as the Model X. And the Model 3 is almost as good as the Model S. It stands to reason that the Model 2 will be almost as good as the Model 3.

And because of this, Tesla might want to do two things:

1. Make the Model 2 production far away. 2025-2026 is a good time frame to announce full production. Sure, it won't actually come out until 2027, but people will start saving, and put off buying their budget cars. (It is important to note that people putting off buying budget cars doesn't hurt Tesla because Tesla doesn't sell a budget car. It will hurt budget car manufacturers.)

2. Make the Model 2 a clearly inferior car. I would cap the Model 2 at 250+ miles range for the base. Make it a 55 kWh (50kWh usable) battery pack. (I would be almost tempted to go lower, and go to 45kWh usable, but I think you might be able to still squeeze out 250+ miles of range.) Additionally, I think you are going to want to reduce the size (and therefore weight and cost) of the motor. The Model 3 has 271 horsepower at its base. The motor weighs about 210 pounds. I don't think a Model 2 needs more than 150 horsepower. That drops weigh and cost, just like reducing battery sizes. The Model 3 weighs in at 3600 lbs. I think the Model 2 would be somewhere closer to 3000 lbs. This would give the Model 2 a 0-60 time very similar to a modern Camry. 

*By making a smaller battery pack, using a smaller engine, and making it an inferior car, you could reduce the cost back closer to $19,000.*

**However, the Model 2 is going to have a TON of benefits, especially for Tesla.**

First off, it allows Tesla to use less batteries. That is the most limiting factor. They are still battery constrained. And probably will be for the remainder of the decade.

Next, it will allow for more sales of FSD. I believe that FSD will be Tesla's largest profit source. Be it as a service ($250/mo) or purchased ($15,000). The more chances you have to sell FSD, the more profit you have.

With those greater sales of FSD, you get more data, making FSD better. Additionally, it allows faster updating of traffic conditions and changes in the road. If you have 5 vehicles pass down a road in a day, each one will be able to feed information to the next about how to better handle that specific location.

Next, the used Model 2's could be flipped into RoboTaxis. Tesla gets the data, and then, when the leases run out (or when the buyer sells the car back to Tesla), the car is reconditioned, and sent out as a RoboTaxi. After FSD, this is likely to be Tesla's next biggest profit source, and perhaps would supplant FSD in the 2030s.

However, none of this is going to happen quickly. They need to build a series of factories. They need a lot of lithium. And they don't want to go too fast. To be honest, they might be better off decreasing the price of the Model 3 and Y first. But even announcing the Model 2 might hurt Toyota and Honda even more than Tesla, since they are the ones selling $28,000 cars. Why buy a Toyota or Honda when you can get a Tesla in 2-4 years? And why wait for a Model 2 when a Model 3 can be leased right now for $349 (with $4500 down)?

You really wanna mess with Toyota and Honda? If you put down a $100 deposit now, Tesla can promise you that you will be guaranteed a $249 lease when cars start coming out. Or, for that same deposit, you can get a $399/mo payment for a 60 month loan.","teslainvestorsclub",31,"https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/11e0ynj/how_tesla_could_produce_a_car_that_costs_369/"
