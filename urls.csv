198,10/10/2023,1696969103,Looking for a notifications watch with good battery life,"Hello there!

Im not sure if such thing actually exists but I still have hope.

I use a smartwatch to get notifications. This is my primary and almost only use case since the Pebble times. When a notification comes, I want to understand if this is something urgent or not. 

I could use something like Kronaby to notify me only on the important matters. The problem is that I wont be able to read the text. Sometimes, its convenient just to have a glance on the wrist when my wife messages me to get something from the grocery store.

I dont care about the workout features at all. In fact, I usually turn them off if its possible. I do so to save battery life because this is important to me.

As an iPhone user I could get an Apple Watch (I had one). It covers all my needs but 1 day of battery life is ridiculous. I start thinking about one of those solar Garmins, even though I wont use like 98% of their features.

So, maybe you know. Does a notification watch with good battery life exist? Basically, I want my Pebble experience back but without DIY resurrection of an old Pebble watch.

Thanks a lot!",smartwatch,22

130,10/17/2023,1697571924,"Amazfit, xiaomi or anything else?","Hi, 
I'm a bit torn between Amazfit balance and xiaomi watch 2 pro as next smartwatch (or maybe even something totally different). 

What I'm looking for: 
- at least ""okay"" gym tracking / weightlifting (doesn't need to count reps etc. As i have had this on Garmin instinct and it was nice, but in a long run quite useless)
- somewhat good gps / running tracking (in and outdoor - potentially support for HR strap would be also good if built in HR sensor would not be top notch)
- sleep tracking being something more than ""you went to sleep at 10 and woke up at 6"" 
- hiking mode with altimeter (and this basically throws our Fitbit charge 6 from my list)
- flat screen (I'm super obsessed with scratches and all non-flat screens and putting TPU on them makes me suffer) 

I can charge each day (but 2+ days of battery life would be nice) and basically I'm torn between those two as in title, but maybe there's something else I'm not aware of (in a budget up to 400$). Xiaomi design is nice, also having it with LTE support would be quite okay - however I'm wondering how accurate hr, sleep and so on are (+ if this does have altimeter at all). 

Been using coros apex 2 pro (overkill), instinct 2x (too big + solar is useless in PL for most of the year) and few other watches. Coros was okay, however I found out that I'm not really using 70% of it's potential for most of the year (I'm not a hardcore climber or diver or so, casual guy, going to gym / running 3 times per week). 
Any advice?",smartwatch,14
11,10/3/2023,1696308693,Durable Smartwatch for Fitness Training,"Hello,

I'm looking for my first smartwatch for the purposes of everyday wear but focused on tracking my fitness training - please could you point me in the right direction of what to get?

I'd like the device to have (in order of preference):

1) As accurate GPS as possible (will be mainly used to track running, road cycling and swimming along with gym sessions and the occasional thing such as mountain biking or rock climbing etc).
2) 10 ATM water resistance as I do a lot of swimming.
3) A decently strong structure - I know nothing is unbreakable but I'd prefer it not to become non functional if I take a tumble whilst running or on my bike etc. Kind of like the Garmin Instinct series.
4) Training metrics like pace etc.
5) Activity/sleep tracking with HR etc. (Regarding HR - I'll be using a chest strap for actual training) - so sleep tracking is the most important thing for me.
6) Music control is preferred - onboard music isn't needed.
7) Price preferably under £450 or so.

I have a 165mm wrist so it needs to fit comfortably without being too big or too small as I'll be wearing a lot - I'm not too concerned about aesthetics - so long as it's not so big and colourful that it attracts attention.

At the moment my options are:

1) Garmin Instinct 2S (Solar) - but I've seen reviews say the GPS isn't as accurate as accurate as some other models on this list.
2) Polar Grit X Pro - reviews say it's very laggy and accuracy isn't comparable to multiband GPS. 
3) Suunto 9 Peak Pro - Accuracy seems OK (but not multiband) but I'm concerned about the screen and overall fragility. 
4) Instinct Crossover - seems to have better GPS than anything apart from multiband, but I would rather have as less moving parts as possible.
5) Instinct 2X Solar - this seems like it would be perfect except for the size. Would it be too big to fit on my wrist? 
6) Coros Apex Pro 2 - doesn't seem as durable as the rest and is only 5ATM.

Which of these would be the most appropriate for me? Alternatively, what others would you suggest?

Thank you!",smartwatch,13
12,10/2/2023,1696285059,Scarring from watch?,"I should lead with the fact that I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which mostly means all of my collagen is very bad; I bruise easily, have very sensitive skin, but generally heal well.

177,10/9/2023,1696847091,Want a new smartwatch,"Hey all, so basically what the title says. 

I currently have an Amazfit GTS 2e, but after a couple of years it's starting to falter a little, as well as seeing the direction that Amazfit is going, I am becoming disenchanted by it (the app tries to make you subscribe to premium features to the point where it becomes annoying and makes you feel like they're just looking for ways to get your money).

I also have an Oppo Band but it literally dies in the middle of the night, battery life isn't that long (1-2 says) and I think Oppo measures activities a bit differently than its competitors (burnt calories are always a tad inferior).

I am somewhat resilient to buy smartwatches that are made by phone manufacturers as they always include features that are specifically tailored for said phones (ex: Oppo's wearables work best with Oppo smartphones). However, I don't mind being proven wrong regarding this.

So basically, I'd greatly appreciate if I could get some recommendations that check these requirements:

- Decent battery life 
- Good sensors for accurate measurements 
- Good/cool design (I know it's very subjective)
- Brand that does not make smartphones (such as Garmin or Amazfit)
- Around 350¬ 
- Other features like NFC payments are welcome, but are not 100% needed

263,10/1/2023,1696188350,Looking for suggestions for a watch that is not focused on fitness and exercise,"I've been having a difficult time nailing down a smartwatch that I want. Most are designed with exercise routines and fitness as the main feature, which I really have no interest in. I want something that has health monitoring features like SpO2, heart rate, sleep monitoring and has a customizable face. Easy access to a stopwatch, or a timer would be nice.

Things I do not care about are playing music, voice, phone calls, exercise monitoring, or sending/receiving messages. I don't need but wouldn't mind step counting.

My wife has a Garmin watch to replace her Fitbit watch, and I have to say, I really like the display on the Garmin watches because they are very readable outside. But, I'm open in that area.

I'd like to keep less than $300.

Edit: Follow up: Oct 27, 2023 - I ended up getting an ""Amazfit (Zepp) Balance"" for $230  
It came down to the Galaxy 5/6 or the Amazfit Balance and I went with the Balance in large part because of price. I don't have any real time spent using a Galaxy Watch, so this is just my impression of the Amazfit watch. 

tldr; Nice watch, great display, great battery life, no technical issues at all so far. Very configurable and user friendly. But, wish it had more watch faces and apps, and could turn off reminders, help messages.

\------

It feels solid and well made. I find the app nice, easy to use and despite having bluetooth on most of the time, it's not affecting battery life of my phone much.

Battery life of the watch is very good in my opinion. I charged it to 87% when I got it last Saturday (10/21) and right now it is at 36% and I have most of the continuous monitoring (heart beat, SpO2) turned on. So, I expect that I can go more than a week without having to recharge. 

I like the button that works as a scroll wheel. It's implemented well and is useful for scrolling through longer lists so you don't have to repeatedly slide your finger across the watch face. (Not sure if other watches have this feature) The display is great! Sharp, clear and good color. 

It's very configurable. I was able to hide pretty much all the exercise features and focus on health and functionality. Even has a stop watch and timer! The ""card page"" is configurable so I can hide or show what I want and in the order I want. 

What I think could be a little better is the number of choices and styles for watch face. Many of them are too busy for me, or don't have everything I'd like on the face. The app store is pretty small - they have their own Zepp OS and app store, so it's not compatible with Samsung or Google Wear. But, it has pretty much everything I personally wanted out of the box, so it is not a problem. But, I could see it being a major downside for some.

The SpO2 and sleep monitoring could be better. When compared to my finger pulse oximeter, the Balance tends to read a little high, by about 4-5%. The sleep report features that come with the watch are pretty basic. They offer an add-on package for better reports. My arms are pretty hairy so it might be interfering with the readings.

I also wish there was a way to turn off the mindful/reminder/encouragement notifications. I know when I feel tired, and I do sit for more than an hour because it's part of my job. Some people may like the reminders, but I don't care to see them.

97,10/24/2023,1698139428,Amazfit Balance vs Huawei GT 4,"I have asked opinions here a while ago about which smartwatch to get, since then I've made my research and narrowed it down to these 2 options for the time being. 

I value battery life and these 2 seem like the best price for quality watches that can last up to 2 weeks. 

I've seen a couple reviews and apparently they're quite similar OS wise, with a couple feature key differences:

\- Amazfit has NFC payments

\- Huawei has wireless charing 

Both of these are things I value, but not necessarily must haves for me, even though wireless charging is very cool, I hardly see myself *needing* it on a watch that only needs charging once every 2 weeks, I see myself using the NFC payments though, even though I already use them on my phone.

I currently own a 1st generation Amazfit GTR for over 3 years and been a bit disappointed with it, the sensors are innacurate, the GPS doesn't work consistently and lately it takes up a whole day to charge. I'm a bit skeptical about remaining on the Amazfit ecossystem because of my current experience, but reviews seem to point the Balance as a very good improvement on its predecessors. On the other hand many people seem to choose Huawei because of the brand reliability alone.

To my shock there wasn't anything good enough to replace my current watch, there was always something missing. But Garmin Venu 3 was released recently and i think that would be an ideal replacement, but looking at the stats, it won't offer much more than my current watch. 

Huawei lasts for almost 2 weeks, has a good display, sleep tracking, nap recognising (which is being promoted as one of the amazing features for Venu 3 lol), recovery time, etc etc. You cannot install apps but it has everything i ever needed so i didn't worry about that. 

What i would get with Venu 3 are NFC payments and Garmin app sync with vitality, not sure if that is enough features to upgrade for £449?

Now everyone talks about how great Wear OS is, and one of the things that attracts me the most is the ability of using Google Pay on my watch, however there isn't a single watch out there with Wear OS that lasts more than 2 days, and this is a big setback for me, because I never take my watch off unless I need to charge it and I'm used to using it uninterrupted for at least a week, I feel like I won't be able to adopt a routine where I need to charge it every other day, this will make me lose either a night of sleep tracking or at least some part of my day, I feel like that defeats the purpose of having a smartwatch.

I really enjoyed the music controls, and some of the nifty tricks you could do to controls apps, volume, audio status and more. However, I HATED charging it so often. So then I moved over to a Xiaomi Mi band 4. I really loved it's battery life and that I had both pedometer, heart tracking, and sleep tracking. I think I was able to drop my stuff into strava, as opposed to their fitness stuff, which I didn't care for. To me I found this to be great since it was strong on battery life, showed me notifications, and let me control music. I found it lacking in the ability to control music while working out. I ended up losing it on a boat trip. I tried a misfit command for a while since it looked great. It has horrible connectivity, could barely use it's functional buttons, and the minute and hour hands were never in sync. Great looks, horrible user experience. Finally I got a hand me down Fitbit luxe. A mishmash of Miband features, with better UI on the app and integrations. However after 2-3 years, the battery is pretty mediocre, it has syncing issues every 3-4 days, and never updates to the app. However over everything I find ones under $100 most appealing.   


My desires out of a watch

* Multiday battery life (5+ days if possible)
* Music Controls

* Sleep monitoring

Requirements:
Longer battery life - currently using an LG sport smartwatch which barely makes it 12 hours. 

Viewing notifications on watch via tilt to wake - I want to be able to just flip my wrist up and see the notification display/scroll without having to hit any buttons or the screen. This is for driving etc to quickly check notifications. 

Mechanical Hands - 95% of the time I just want to look at my wrist and know the time so having mechanical hands that are easy to read in all lighting levels is important. 


That is all the requirements I have. I don't care about fitness tracking, sleep tracking, health monitoring, gps etc. 

Basically I just want a watch that also displays notifications. I don't want to respond or really use the screen on the watch for any kind of input, just read the time and notifications. 


Everything I have found seems to do WAY more than I am needing. 

I have looked at Fossil Hybrids, Garmin Hybrids, the Scanwatch hybrids, and AmazFit watches. The scanwatch is probably the closest but the part of the screen that shows notifications is way smaller than the entire screen. 

I have looked at the Garmin Vivomove trend as well which looks ok but again has way more features than I am looking for and potentially the interface can be a bit laggy? I really would like something that is snappy to interact with for the limited amount of things I would like to do on the watch. 

The Skagen Jorn watches look nice as well but are discontinued apparently.

And if the Samsung is the better option (I have a Samsung phone and am a big fan of their phones) which watch is the best option? Is there another compatible brand that's better?",smartwatch,2

1) battery life - all 3 options appear fairly decent
decent here.

2) alarm, specifically vibration alarm - the huaweis is good and does wake me up, hard to find info on the 3 choices and strength of vibrate.

3) GPS - like to track cycling, Garmin appears clear winner on that front, with mixed reviews about amazfit open to user views though.

4) HR accuracy - I know they'll never be spot on, but from what I see garmin is again better?

5) Sleep tracking - more accurate the better, again mixed reviews on all?

63,10/9/2023,1696837265,Smartwatch for running &amp; everyday use?,"Just before I launch into my current situation, I would like to caveat that I've been researching fitness smartwatches on Google and YouTube for weeks but I'm getting to the point where I'm going in circles/mad. Would really appreciate some help from this community!

I'm on the market for a smartwatch/fitness tracker for everyday use, which I can wear in my corporate job, at social events and for exercise. 

In terms of my lifestyle, I have recently taken up running properly. I'm really enjoying it, and running several times a week. Although I'm a beginner, I am certain that it'll become a staple in my routine before long. I'd like to train towards a half marathon. I also do weights in the gym 3-4 times a week and occasionally hike on weekends. In terms of exercise tracking, my priority is running but if I can get something to help out in the gym/hike too then great.

As mentioned, it needs to look in keeping for a work environment, but I think sports watches are becoming more accepted.

I'm not bothered about smart features, but I am tempted by WearOS as I'd like to use built-in apps like Nike Run Club and Google Fit. My one deal breaker is being able to download music/podcasts so I can leave my phone at home. Im k terested jn learning as mich about my health as I can from a watch. 

In terms of budget, I'm looking at around the £250 mark. I get a pretty good discount of up to 40% on Garmins from work. 

So, I've narrowed my search to the following:

- Garmin Venu 2 - seems to tick a lot of boxes but worried it may not give me the running metrics I need. 
- Garmin Forerunner 255 Music - worried that this may be overkill for my level. Doesn't look as sleek as the others.
- Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (secondhand) - looks great and has the apps I need but worried that the GPS capabilities would throw off my running training. Good health analysis though. P

Hi,

I'm looking for a smartwatch with GPS+LTE+NFC that will work as an extension to my phone. I want to be able to use media controls on the watch face, pay for things through Google pay on my pixel 6 and use maps on the watch screen. I want it to be able to send and receive calls and texts, without having my phone present. I don't want it do do anything else.

The Google watches (and maybe wearOS generally?) don't allow for disabling of the heartrate sensors so I'm not interested because the battery is going to be negatively affected by things I'm not after, and they have terrible reviews regardless. The Samsung ones don't allow you to disable them either ( which is insane right it's my watch why can't I choose?) and I have a pixel so I can't get an apple watch SE which is the obvious choice. Huwaei does offer one but I don't want to pay 500 for a smartwatch which I'm going to nuke to the same level of features as an apple watch SE which costs less than 300.

Garmin don't do one, they advertise it as LTE but it cannot send texts or calls it's purely for safety. Ticwatch used to do one but its not available where I live. Fossil used to do one, maybe they still do but I don't have access to Verizon.

30,10/25/2023,1698221591,Elevate Your Fitness: The Smartwatch Advantage,"Smartwatches can be valuable tools for staying fit and maintaining a healthy lifestyle for several reasons:

Activity Tracking: Smartwatches typically come with built-in sensors such as accelerometers, heart rate monitors, and GPS, allowing them to track your physical activity. They can monitor steps taken, distance traveled, calories burned, and even the intensity of your workouts. This data can help you set and achieve fitness goals.

Heart Rate Monitoring: Many smartwatches continuously monitor your heart rate, providing real-time feedback on your cardiovascular health. This data can be crucial for optimizing your workouts and ensuring you're exercising within your target heart rate zone.

Workout Guidance: Smartwatches often come with workout modes and pre-installed fitness apps that can guide you through various exercises, from running and cycling to yoga and strength training. Some can even provide real-time coaching and feedback.

Sleep Tracking: A significant aspect of overall health and fitness is sleep quality. Smartwatches can track your sleep patterns and provide insights into your sleep duration, sleep cycles, and interruptions. This information can help you make necessary adjustments to improve your sleep.

Goal Setting and Motivation: Smartwatches allow you to set fitness goals and receive notifications and reminders to help you stay on track. The sense of achievement and progress can be motivating and encourage you to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Health Monitoring: Beyond fitness, many smartwatches offer health monitoring features like blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) tracking, stress tracking, and more. These features can provide valuable insights into your overall well-being.

Integration with Health Apps: Smartwatches often sync with health and fitness apps on your smartphone, allowing you to centralize and analyze your data. This makes it easier to track your progress over time and share your achievements with friends or healthcare professionals.

Notifications and Reminders: Smartwatches can keep you connected while you work out by delivering notifications for calls, messages, and app alerts. They can also remind you to stand, move, or take a break during your day, helping you maintain an active lifestyle.

Music and Connectivity: Many smartwatches have music storage and streaming capabilities, making it easy to listen to your favorite tunes during workouts. Some also offer the ability to make contactless payments, so you can stay fueled and hydrated on the go.

Waterproof and Durability: Many smartwatches are designed to withstand water, making them suitable for swimming and other water-based activities. They are also built to withstand the rigors of exercise and daily wear.

It's important to note that while smartwatches can be helpful tools for staying fit, they are not a replacement for a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and overall healthy habits. They should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive approach to health and fitness.

When I first got it, I only used it for a few weeks before leaving it in my bedside drawer for months. It worked perfect before and I never got it wet or even had it on outside. I put it on the charger and nothing happened, even after hours. I tried a different charger and block both USB-C and everything was an apple product. I tried holding down the 2 buttons at the same time on and off the charger and nothing happened. I tried just holding down the power button as well and its still just a black screen. I tried everything I saw on YouTube. Screen is still black. No green or red bolt. No Apple logo or noises just always a black screen. I have no damage to it never dropped it I barely used it.

Unfortunately they were unable to boot it up. They tested my block and my 2 chargers and they both worked perfectly. They couldnt diagnose the problem with the watch. They tried fast charging and some power thing. They said they dont see anything damage to it.

187,10/7/2023,1696713946,"smartwatch focused on health stats, with some exercise info too","My interests are

* being able to download and view your data without connecting to their servers, or someone elses

* data safety (given recent situations, I have concerns about how law enforcement and insurance companies may use your data, particularly as I'm female)

* tracking heart at rest, any spikes or changes when standing/sitting, climbing stairs

* alerts of abnormal heart rhythms etc (I don't want to be woken up, but I'd like to know about it). Just so I have a history that I can bring up with doc and they can decide if further action is needed. Give me some leverage basically. No I'm not imagining my heart is racing in my sleep, here it is, now you can't ignore it. Perimenopause does heart things, so can covid, I'm mostly trying to collect data to argue with doctors. Others have said this helps.

* tracking sleep (not deep/rem, but rather when I'm asleep/awake/napping). Blood ox and heart rate tracking while asleep would be more important to me.

* HRV - see how I'm recovering from exercise (mostly walking rn), and improve or optimize recovery as best I can.

* maybe climbing stairs/elevation, I walk up stairs to trains, at home, etc, it would be nice to track when it is and how I'm handling it.

* I do bike sometimes, and am planning on starting some light routines involving lifting weights, and it sounds like anything that causes wrist movement can throw the sensor off. Also curious about things I do with my hands, fixing things, or cleaning, or typing, if that has impact.

* It sounds like you can get 1 lead ekg off a chest strap? Which sounds interesting. Though I have big boobs and wear underwire bras, and I hear a chest strap can be a bit uncomfortable, not sure how well it works with the underwire. In that direction it sounds like the polar straps are good, so I'd like the watch to be compatible.

* I haven't found yet if the BT or other transmission between watch and other things (chest strap, smart phone) is encrypted.

* I don't really care about smart stuff, like calls, texts, music, etc.

* I have a budget android phone

* When I used to wear an analog watch, I have a tendency to walk into or clip doorframes and scratched up the face, one time I had to figure out how to get the latex paint from the door frame out of the scratches. I beat the hell out of things not intending to. How do you protect the face? I used to turn the watch face to the inside of my wrist, but that's not practical for the sensor.

* comfortable straps that don't hold water when you wash your hands etc. 

* I haven't worn anything in a while, so I'm not sure how I might react to the watch (I have histamine intolerance and new allergic reactions to things I didn't before). I'm not sure if some are more ""hypoallergenic"" than others.

From what I've learned so far it sounds like Garmin doesn't sell your data, but they don't encrypt it and all employees can see your personal data. I think you can download your data, but not sure what you get from it. I think the Venu Sq 3 that's just out does nap tracking and stairs. And I'm not sure that the other versions do both. I'm hoping to get something this holiday season, I think the VS3 is out of my price range though. 

It sounds like garmin watches check at shorter intervals than apple and have better battery life, so it might catch spikes maybe, but on a delay, but not as well as a chest strap, because the optical is not as accurate.

It sounds like apple encrypts your data at rest and in transit? But I'm not sure about how they are about releasing data and selling data. Also can you download your own data without connecting to the cloud/internet? A lot of people seem to like the heart data they can get from it. Though I guess you can't use it without an iphone. 

Polar, I don't know much about right now in terms of watches, but they seem to have an armband with a sensor that some liked better compared to a smartwatch or chest strap. And their chest strap seems well regarded. 

fitbit is google, so privacy nightmare. I do use android but I've debloated my phone and shut down a number of google services (which dramatically increased the battery life). I might be able to get lineage os on it. And it sounds like samsung is also not to be trusted.",smartwatch,1

244,10/13/2023,1697228168,Making a Choice: Apple Watch Series 9 or Garmin Venu 3 for Health Stats,"I've thought so much about this and I can't decide which one would suit me more. So I'm asking for some of your thoughts and experiences.My mindset behind this is that I would look at my wrist and have a device that reports my vitals like a  health bar or a hud video game style haha...so by that I mean I mainly want to see stuff like:

* heart rate
* blood oxygen
* respiration rate
* HRV
* altitude 
* calories burned...

I would want these stats constantly updated and receive notifications of whenever I'm lazy, abnormal heart readings like irregular rhythm, high/low rate, stressed,...

I like Garmin's stress tracking, body battery, nap detection, sleep coach...I also wounder if there's anything similar in apple watch?  Also it's a bit of a bummer that Garmin's ECG app is not available in Europe (without using vpn and stuff)

So I'm not sure if true, but I read that apple watches aren't checking your vitals that often? like a few times per hour, where Garmin's checking very often and precise?

Other than that I would like to use notes/cheatsheets, occasionally navigation and manage messages/calls.

As for fitness, I would like to track small workouts here and there, hikes but nothing too crazy.I also have an iPhone so being in the ecosystem would be great, I just can't decide if Garmin's a better pick here. Also how's Series 9 doing battery wise if anyone would use it in the way I would?

Is there anything I missed? Which would you choose?

  
About me: 

\- Very clumsy (so physical durability is a must) and forgetful (I constantly use alarms/reminders &amp; task apps throughout the day, and appreciate a good battery for when I forget to charge)  
\- I walk everywhere (no car) and like to go hiking/camping/do other outdoor activities, archery, some yoga, weight training/basic cardio, etc. No sports, no extreme training.  
\- Want to play music and track my route/use navigation features without frying the watch battery too quickly  
\- Care a lot about health-tracking features (blood oxygen saturation, heart rate inconsistency, etc.) and fitness coaching (again, I'm NOT an extreme athlete by any means, just a regular person who wants to utilize free workouts with feedback.)   
\- Will probably never use the voice feature on either watch, but definitely will use it for text messaging.

&amp;#x200B;

**Galaxy Watch 6 Classic:**

*Pros:*

* Price (about $50-100 less than Venu 3, plus even cheaper if I trade in my old Fit2) 
* Tactile bezel (really nice for navigating menus!)
* Screen durability (Sapphire crystal vs. the Venu 3's Gorilla Glass only)
* More storage (16 GB vs. 8 GB on Garmin) for music &amp; apps
* Better watch bands (currently anyway - includes a nice eco leather + stretchy fabric option without any upcharge, whereas Garmin has only unpleasant silicone by default) - also new band system is easy to swap
* More variety of apps, better Smart Watch features in general (texting with actual Swype keyboard and emojis, a big visual layout of apps, grouping apps with named categories, etc.)
* Phone camera controller, better phone integration in general if Samsung (I have a Galaxy S7 and will likely upgrade to S24 next year)
* Snoring detection (interesting I guess? but I'd rather have naps)

*Cons:*

* Battery life (TERRIBLE horror stories - some people can't even get 1 full day without charging! Would have to buy the 47mm model just to get 2 days (at best!) even though I think the 43mm would suit my wrist better)
* No new hardware? (Just using an overclocked version of the previous chip and other things renamed for marketing, but doesn't seem to actually be \*new\*)
* Inaccurate sensor data (have been watching different videos/reading reviews that suggest most of the monitoring features like heartrate, blood ox, sleep tracking, etc are wildly incorrect when compared with medical devices) - no point in all these coaching features if the data they're using is bad
* No HRV monitoring
* No nap detection, just tells you your ""sleep animal"" :P
* Concerns of planned obsolescence (Samsung cranks out new watches too quickly with only incremental updates)

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

**Garmin Venu 3s:**

*Pros:*

* Battery life (can comfortably buy the smaller 3s model and still get up to 10 days battery life - probably realistically more like 3-5 with all features on - or up to 14 days on the larger 3 model)
* Morning Update and evening summary (includes everything I'd want to know at these times, not sure if Samsung offers the equivalent)
* Nap detection (I am a biphasic sleeper/frequent napper so this would be ideal)
* HRV monitoring (for recovery/stress checks, just nice to have in general)
* Hydration tracking
* Body Battery (clear and compact way to display data) and in general prefer Garmin's data collection &amp; display over Samsung Health
* Better accuracy of sensor data (not by much from what I've seen, but since Venu 3 includes the latest sensors that are normally included in higher-end Fenix/Epix lines, they might be better overall)
* More fitness focus - better workout information, more variety of activities, etc.
* Can use iPhone or Android (though this is mostly irrelevant as I stick to droids)

*Cons:*

* Price, especially considering the cheaper screen and plastic materials used, hard to justify extra $100.
* Currently no ECG (but the sensors are \*capable\* of monitoring ECG - likely in a future update after FDA approval)
* No blood pressure monitoring? No temperature either? At least not that I could see.
* Silicone watch band only (for now) - cheap and irritating
* Fewer apps (more focused on fitness than Smart Watch features)
* Hard to text message (old school numeric style ""keyboard"" if not using the premade ""Yes/No/On my way"" replies)
* Too much fitness focus for me? (I am not a sporty athlete, not training for races or anything like that -- my needs will never be as extreme as what Garmin can handle.)
* Customer support? (Heard occasional negativity here, but I don't actually know enough about the brand to confirm)

Around 6 years ago I had an Apple Watch, bought it used for 150¬ at that time and it was amazing. Good sleep tracking, could use the Apps Spotify and Calm on it, store music or meditation offline and use better Sleep Tracking Apps from the App Store. And it felt high quality. I tried a couple of Android Smartwatches since but I can't find anything close to that. (Under 300¬) And I have an Android device, so it can't be an apple watch, sadly.
