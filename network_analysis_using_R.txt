## Social network analysis using R
Social network analysis is a method or tool by which one can analyze the connections across individuals or groups or institutions.

It allows us to examine how actors (e.g.consumers) or institutions (e.g.companies) are interrelated.

The advantage of social network analysis is that, unlike many other methods, it focuses on interaction (rather than on individual behavior).

A network analysis might assess the network for changes in structure deriving from technological disruptions.

This tutorial starts with a simple example and draws from another tutorial by Katherine Ognyanova that has a more in depth look at some of the features of igraph (2016) of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())# clear memory

#install.packages ("igraph")
#library(igraph)# load package igraph
##I. Edge lists: graph() and get.edgelist(): graph() id starts from 1.
library(igraph)

```


```{r}
g_el <- graph( c(1,2, 1,3, 2,3, 3,4 ), directed=FALSE)
summary(g_el)
plot(g_el)
```


```{r}
g5 <- graph_from_literal(Jimmy-Mother-Farther-Wife, Jimmy-Farther, Jimmy-Wife, Jimmy-A, A-B, Jimmy-G-E, Jimmy-E )

plot(g5)
```
